Neonatal resuscitation: Flow chart\n\n**Initial Steps:**\n- Dry the infant immediately with a clean cloth.\n- Keep warm by skin-to-skin contact and covered.\n\n**Assessment A:**\n\nLook for:\n- Breathing or crying\n- Good muscle tone or vigorous movements\n\n**If YES:** → Routine care (see section 3.1)\n\n**If NO:** ↓\n\n- Stimulate by rubbing the back 2 to 3 times.\n- Suction only if had meconium stained liquor or the mouth or nose is full of secretions.\n\n**Assessment after stimulation:**\n- **If Breathing:** → Routine care and closely observe breathing\n- **If Not breathing, or gasping:** ↓\n\n**CALL FOR HELP**\n\n**Assessment B:**\n- Transfer to newborn resuscitation area.\n- Position the head/neck slightly extended.\n- Start positive pressure ventilation with mask and self-inflating bag within 1 min of birth.<sup>a</sup>\n- Make sure the chest is moving adequately.\n\n**After 30-60 seconds:**\n\nCheck the heart rate (HR) with a stethoscope.\n\n**If Breathing well:** → Observe closely if continues to breathe well\n\n**Heart Rate Assessment:**\n\n**If HR < 60/min:** → Chest compressions until HR ≥ 100/min (see figure on p. 48)\n\n**If HR 60-100/min:**\n- Take corrective steps.\n- Continue to ventilate at 40 breaths per min.\n\n**Assessment C:**\n- Consider higher oxygen concentration.\n- Suction, if necessary.\n- Reassess every 1-2 min.\n\n**If HR > 100/min:**\n- Continue to ventilate at 40 breaths per min.\n- Every 1-2 min stop to see if breathing spontaneously.\n- Stop ventilating when respiratory rate is > 30 breaths per min.\n- Give post resuscitation care. (see section 3.2.1, p. 50).\n\n**If HR remains problematic:**\n- Give higher oxygen concentration.\n- If HR remains at < 60/min, consider:\n  - Other ventilatory support.\n  - IV adrenaline.\n  - Refer where possible\n\n**If no HR for > 10 min or remains < 60/min for 20 min:** discontinue (see section 3.2.2, p. 50).\n\n----\n\n<sup>a</sup> Positive pressure ventilation should be initiated with air for infants with gestation > 32 weeks. For very preterm infants, it is preferable to start with 30% oxygen if possible. A and B are basic resuscitation steps.", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 1, "section": "Pocket Book of Hospital care for children"}}

{"content": "Preface\n\n# Preface\n\nThis is the second edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) *Pocket book of hospital care for children*, which was first published in 2005. It is a compilation of the updated WHO guidelines for the management of common childhood illnesses at the first-referral level in low-resource countries. It presents relevant, up-to-date, evidence-based clinical guidelines that can be used by clinicians in their daily work in hospitals with basic laboratory facilities and inexpensive medicines. The guidelines focus on inpatient management of children who are severely ill with conditions that are major causes of childhood mortality, such as neonatal illness, pneumonia, diarrhoea, fever (mainly malaria, meningitis and septicaemia), severe acute malnutrition and HIV/AIDS. It also includes guidance on common surgical problems, appropriate supportive care and monitoring of patients on the ward.\n\nThe *Pocket book* is part of a series of tools for improving the quality of care for severely ill children and is consistent with the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines for outpatient management of sick children. It is for use by doctors, senior nurses and other senior health workers who are responsible for the care of young children at the first referral level in developing countries.\n\nThe first edition of the *Pocket book* was reviewed by a WHO guidelines steering committee, which identified those chapters that required updating, comprising:\n\n* revisions to align the *Pocket book* with recently published, WHO-approved guidelines; and\n* priorities for which new information had become available, which was collated, analysed and synthesized before updating.\n\nIn the first category, recommendations approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee were incorporated. The second category required synthesis of evidence and updates consistent with new recommendations. The changes made are therefore based on published WHO guidelines and recommendations as of 2012, which are listed in the bibliography on p. 329; in addition, certain subsections were added or removed, others reorganized and some editorial changes made on the basis of feedback from *Pocket book* users. In response to users' feedback and the popularity of the first edition, the presentation is similar.\n\nxv", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 17, "section": "Preface"}}

Prevention of mother to child HIV transmission, and infant feeding\n\nThe *Pocket book* is presented in a format that could be carried by doctors, nurses and other health workers during their daily work and be available to help guide the management of sick children. Although some new topics have been added, standard textbooks of paediatrics should be consulted for rarer conditions not covered in the *Pocket book*. These guidelines are applicable in most areas of the world and may be adapted by countries to suit their specific circumstances.\n\nWHO recommends that countries should locally adapt the *Pocket book* to include important conditions not covered and believes its widespread adoption would improve the care of children in hospital and lead to lower case fatality rates.\n\nxvii", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 19, "section": "Additional sections or subsections in this second edition"}}

Manage the airway and give oxygen.\n* **Step 2.** Quickly check whether the child is in shock or has diarrhoea with severe dehydration. Give oxygen and start IV fluid resuscitation. In trauma, if there is external bleeding, compress the wound to stop further blood loss.\n* **Step 3.** Quickly determine whether the child is unconscious or convulsing. Give IV glucose for hypoglycaemia and/or an anti-convulsant for convulsing.\n\n**If emergency signs are found:**\n\n* Call for help from an experienced health professional if available, but do not delay starting treatment. Stay calm and work with other health workers who may be required to give the treatment, because a very sick child may need several treatments at once. The most experienced health professional should continue assessing the child (see Chapter 2, p. 41), to identify all underlying problems and prepare a treatment plan.\n\n* Carry out emergency investigations (blood glucose, blood smear, haemoglobin [Hb]). Send blood for typing and cross-matching if the child is in shock, appears to be severely anaemic or is bleeding significantly.\n\n* After giving emergency treatment, proceed immediately to assessing, diagnosing and treating the underlying problem.\n\nTables of common differential diagnoses for emergency signs are provided from p. 21 onwards.\n\n**If no emergency signs are found, check for priority signs:**\n\n* Tiny infant: any sick child aged < 2 months\n* Temperature: child is very hot\n* Trauma or other urgent surgical condition\n* Pallor (severe)\n* Poisoning (history of)\n* Pain (severe)\n* Respiratory distress\n* Restless, continuously irritable or lethargic\n\n1.

TRIAGE\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF EMERGENCY AND PRIORITY SIGNS\n\n■ Referral (urgent)\n■ Malnutrition: visible severe wasting\n■ Oedema of both feet\n■ Burns (major)\n\nThe above can be remembered from the mnemonic **3TPR MOB**.\n\nThese children need prompt assessment (no waiting in the queue) to determine what further treatment is needed. Move a child with any priority sign to the front of the queue to be assessed next. If a child has trauma or other surgical problems, get surgical help where available.\n\n### 1.3 Assessment of emergency and priority signs\n\n■ **Assess the airway and breathing (A, B)**\n\n*Does the child's breathing appear to be obstructed?* Look at the chest wall movement, and listen to breath sounds to determine whether there is poor air movement during breathing. Stridor indicates obstruction.\n\n*Is there central cyanosis?* Determine whether there is bluish or purplish discoloration of the tongue and the inside of the mouth.\n\n*Is the child breathing?* Look and listen to determine whether the child is breathing.\n\n*Is there severe respiratory distress?* The breathing is very laboured, fast or gasping, with chest indrawing, nasal flaring, grunting or the use of auxiliary muscles for breathing (head nodding). Child is unable to feed because of respiratory distress and tires easily.\n\n■ **Assess circulation (for shock) (C)**\n\nChildren in shock who require bolus fluid resuscitation are lethargic and have cold skin, prolonged capillary refill, fast weak pulse and hypotension.\n\n*Check whether the child's hand is cold.* If so, determine whether the child is in shock.\n\n*Check whether the capillary refill time is longer than 3 s.* Apply pressure to whiten the nail of the thumb or the big toe for 5 s. Determine the time from the moment of release until total recovery of the pink colour.\n\n*If capillary refill is longer than 3 s, check the pulse.* Is it weak and fast? If the radial pulse is strong and not obviously fast, the child is **not** in shock. If you cannot feel the radial pulse of an infant (< 1 year old), feel the brachial pulse or, if the infant is lying down, the femoral pulse. If you cannot feel the radial pulse of a child, feel the carotid.", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 28, "section": "4"}}

Giving IV fluids puts these children at risk of over-hydration and death from heart failure. Therefore, these children should be rehydrated orally with the special rehydration solution for severe malnutrition (ReSoMal). See Chapter 7 (p. 204).\n\n• In severe malnutrition, individual emergency signs of shock may be present even when there is no shock. Malnourished children with many signs of shock: lethargy, reduced level of consciousness, cold skin, prolonged capillary refill and fast weak pulse, should receive additional fluids for shock as above.\n\n• Treatment of a malnourished child for shock differs from that for a well-nourished child, because shock from dehydration and sepsis are likely to coexist, and these are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds alone, and because children with severe malnutrition may not cope with large amounts of water and salt. The amount of fluid given should be guided by the child's response. Avoid over-hydration. Monitor the pulse and breathing at the start and every 5–10 min to check whether they are improving. Note that the type of IV fluid differs for severe malnutrition, and the infusion rate is slower.\n\n*All severely malnourished children require prompt assessment and treatment to deal with serious problems such as hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, severe*\n\nTRIAGE\n1.\n\n19", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 43, "section": "EMERGENCY TREATMENT FOR A CHILD WITH SEVERE MALNUTRITION\n\n**■ Assess for priority signs**\n\nWhile assessing the child for emergency signs, you will have noted several possible priority signs:\n\n*Is there any respiratory distress (not severe)?*\n\n*Is the child lethargic or continuously irritable or restless?*\n\nThis was noted when you assessed for coma.\n\nNote the other priority signs (see p. 6)."}}

Note that traditional medicines can be a source of poisoning.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nA diagnosis is based on a history from the child or carer, a clinical examination and the results of investigations, where appropriate.\n\n* Obtain full details of the poisoning agent, the amount ingested and the time of ingestion. Attempt to identify the exact agent involved and ask to see the container, when relevant. Check that no other children were involved. The symptoms and signs depend on the agent ingested and therefore vary widely – see below.\n\n* Check for signs of burns in or around the mouth or of stridor (upper airway or laryngeal damage), which suggest ingestion of corrosives.\n\n* Admit all children who have deliberately ingested iron, pesticides, paracetamol or aspirin, narcotics or antidepressant drugs; and those who may have been given the drug or poison intentionally by another child or adult.\n\n* Children who have ingested corrosives or petroleum products should not be sent home without observation for at least 6 h.

Ingested poisons must be removed from the stomach.\n\nGastric decontamination is most effective within 1 h of ingestion. After this time, there is usually little benefit, except for agents that delay gastric emptying or in patients who are deeply unconscious. A decision to undertake gastric decontamination must weigh the likely benefits against the risks associated with each method. Gastric decontamination does not guarantee that all the substance has been removed, so the child may still be in danger.\n\nContraindications to gastric decontamination are:\n- an unprotected airway in an unconscious child, except when the airway has been protected by intubation with an inflated tube by the anaesthetist\n- ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products\n\n▶ Check the child for emergency signs (see p. 2) and for hypoglycaemia; if blood glucose is not available and the child has a reduced level of consciousness, treat as if hypoglycaemia (p. 16).\n\n▶ Identify the specific agent and remove or adsorb it as soon as possible. Treatment is most effective if given as quickly as possible after the poisoning event, ideally within 1 h.\n\n• If the child swallowed kerosene, petrol or petrol-based products (note that most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents) or if the child's mouth and throat have been burnt (for example with bleach, toilet cleaner or battery acid), do not make the child vomit but give water or, if available, milk, orally. Call an anaesthetist to assess the airway.\n\n• If the child has swallowed other poisons, never use salt as an emetic, as this can be fatal.\n\n▶ Give activated charcoal, if available, and do not induce vomiting; give by mouth or nasogastric tube at the doses shown in Table 5. If a nasogastric tube is used, be particularly careful that the tube is in the stomach and not in the airway or lungs.\n\n27", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 51, "section": "PRINCIPLES FOR INGESTED POISONS\n\nTRIAGE\n1.\n\noesophageal burns, which may not be immediately apparent, and petroleum products, if aspirated, can cause pulmonary oedema, which may take some hours to develop."}}

Note: Ipecacuanha can cause repeated vomiting, drowsiness and lethargy, which can confuse a diagnosis of poisoning. Never induce vomiting if a corrosive or petroleum-based poison has been ingested.\n\n## Gastric lavage\n\nUndertake gastric lavage only if staff have experience in the procedure, if ingestion was less than 1 h previously and is life-threatening and if the child did not ingest corrosives or petroleum derivatives. Make sure a suction apparatus is available in case the child vomits. Place the child in the left lateral head-down position. Measure the length of tube to be inserted. Pass a 24–28 French gauge tube through the mouth into the stomach, as a smaller nasogastric tube is not sufficient to let particles such as tablets pass. Ensure the tube is in the stomach. Perform lavage with 10 ml/kg of normal saline (0.9%). The volume of lavage fluid returned should approximate the amount of fluid given. Lavage should be continued until the recovered lavage solution is clear of particulate matter.\n\nNote that tracheal intubation by an anaesthetist may be required to reduce the risk of aspiration.\n\n▶ Give a specific antidote if this is indicated.\n▶ Give general care.\n▶ Keep the child under observation for 4–24 h, depending on the poison swallowed.\n▶ Keep unconscious children in the recovery position.\n▶ Consider transferring the child to next level referral hospital only when appropriate and when this can be done safely, if the child is unconscious or has a deteriorating level of consciousness, has burns to the mouth and throat, is in severe respiratory distress, is cyanosed or is in heart failure.", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 52, "section": "28"}}

Use soap and water for oily substances. Attending staff should take care to protect themselves from secondary contamination by wearing gloves and aprons. Removed clothing and personal effects should be stored safely in a see-through plastic bag that can be sealed, for later cleansing or disposal.\n\n### Eye contamination\n* Rinse the eye for 10–15 min with clean running water or normal saline, taking care that the run-off does not enter the other eye if the child is lying on the side, when it can run into the inner canthus and out the outer canthus. The use of anaesthetic eye drops will assist irrigation. Evert the eyelids and ensure that all surfaces are rinsed. When possible, the eye should be thoroughly examined under fluorescein staining for signs of corneal damage. If there is significant conjunctival or corneal damage, the child should be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist.\n\n## 1.6.3 Principles for inhaled poisons\n* Remove the child from the source of exposure.\n* Urgently call for help.\n* Administer supplementary oxygen if the child has respiratory distress, is cyanosed or has oxygen saturation ≤ 90%.\n* Inhalation of irritant gases may cause swelling and upper airway obstruction, bronchospasm and delayed pneumonitis.

The child may complain of vomiting, diarrhoea, blurred vision or weakness. The signs are those of excess parasympathetic activation: excessive bronchial secretion, salivation, sweating, lachrymation, slow pulse, small pupils, convulsions, muscle weakness or twitching, then paralysis and loss of bladder control, pulmonary oedema and respiratory depression.\n\n#### Treatment\n* Remove the poison by irrigating eye if in eye or washing skin if on skin.\n* Give activated charcoal within 4 h of ingestion if ingested.\n* Do not induce vomiting because most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents.\n* In a serious case of ingestion, when activated charcoal cannot be given, consider careful aspiration of stomach contents by nasogastric tube (the airway should be protected).\n* If the child has signs of excess parasympathetic activation (see above), one of the main risks is excessive bronchial secretion. Give atropine at 20 µg/kg (maximum dose, 2000 µg or 2 mg) IM or IV every 5–10 min, depending on the severity of the poisoning, until there is no sign of secretions in the chest, the skin becomes flushed and dry, the pupils dilate and tachycardia develops. Doses may be repeated every 1–4 h for at least 24 h to maintain atropine effects. The main aim is to reduce bronchial secretions while avoiding atropine toxicity. Auscultate the chest for signs of respiratory secretions, and monitor respiratory rate, heart rate and coma score (if appropriate).\n* Check for hypoxaemia by pulse oximetry if atropine is given, as it can cause heart irregularities (ventricular arrhythmia) in hypoxic children.

An antidote is more often required for older children who deliberately ingest paracetamol or when parents overdose children by mistake.\n* If within 8 h of ingestion, give oral methionine or IV acetylcysteine. Methionine can be used if the child is conscious and not vomiting (< 6 years: 1 g every 4 h for four doses; ≥ 6 years: 2.5 g every 4 h for four doses).\n* If more than 8 h after ingestion, or the child cannot take oral treatment, give IV acetylcysteine. Note that the fluid volumes used in the standard regimen are too large for young children.\n  * For children < 20 kg give the loading dose of 150 mg/kg in 3 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 15 min, followed by 50 mg/kg in 7 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 4 h, then 100 mg/kg IV in 14 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 16 h.

If liver enzymes can be measured and are elevated, continue IV infusion until enzyme levels fall.\n\n## Aspirin and other salicylates\nIngestion of these compounds can be very serious in young children because they rapidly become acidotic and are consequently more likely to suffer the severe central nervous system effects of toxicity. Salicylate overdose can be complex to manage.\n\nⓤ These compounds cause acidotic-like breathing, vomiting and tinnitus.\n* Give activated charcoal if available.

The vomit and stools are often grey or black. In severe poisoning, there may be gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypotension, drowsiness, convulsions and metabolic acidosis. Gastrointestinal features usually appear within the first 6 h, and a child who has remained asymptomatic for this time probably does not require an antidote.\n\n▶ Activated charcoal does not bind to iron salts; therefore, consider a gastric lavage if potentially toxic amounts of iron were taken. This also allows deferoxamine, the antidote, to remain in the stomach to counteract any remaining iron.\n\n▶ Decide whether to give the antidote. As this can have side-effects, it should be given only if there is clinical evidence of poisoning (see above).\n\n▶ Give deferoxamine, preferably by slow IV infusion: initially 15 mg/kg per h, reduced after 4–6 h so that the total dose does not exceed 80 mg/kg in 24 h.

Possible additional treatment includes bronchodilators, antihistamines (chlorphenamine at 0.25 mg/kg) and steroids. When the child is stable, re-start antivenom infusion slowly.\n\n* More antivenom should be given after 6 h if there is recurrence of blood clotting disorder or after 1–2 h if the patient is continuing to bleed briskly or has deteriorating neurotoxic or cardiovascular signs.\n\n* Blood transfusion should not be required if antivenom is given. Clotting function returns to normal only after clotting factors are produced by the liver. The response of abnormal neurological signs to antivenom is more variable and depends on the type of venom.\n\n* If there is no response to antivenom infusion, it should be repeated.\n\n* Anticholinesterases can reverse neurological signs in children bitten by some species of snake (see standard textbooks of paediatrics for further details).\n\n## Other treatment\n\n* Surgical opinion: Seek a surgical opinion if there is severe swelling in a limb, it is pulseless or painful or there is local necrosis. Surgical care will include:\n  - excision of dead tissue from wound\n  - incision of fascial membranes (fasciotomy) to relieve pressure in limb compartments, if necessary\n  - skin grafting, if there is extensive necrosis\n  - tracheostomy (or endotracheal intubation) if the muscles involved in swallowing are paralysed\n\n## Supportive care\n\n* Give fluids orally or by nasogastric tube according to daily requirements (see p. 304). Keep a close record of fluid intake and output.\n\n* Provide adequate pain relief.\n\n* Elevate the limb if swollen.\n\n* Give antitetanus prophylaxis.\n\n* Antibiotic treatment is not required unless there is tissue necrosis at the wound site.\n\n* Avoid IM injections.\n\n36", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 60, "section": "1.

Give antivenom, when available, if there are severe local or any systemic effects.\n\nIn general, venomous spider bites can be painful but rarely result in systemic envenoming. Antivenom is available for some species such as widow and banana spiders. Venomous fish can give very severe local pain, but, again, systemic envenoming is rare. Box jellyfish stings are occasionally rapidly life-threatening. Apply vinegar on cotton-wool to denature the protein in the skin. Adherent tentacles should be carefully removed. Rubbing the sting may cause further discharge of venom. Antivenom may be available. The dose of antivenom to jellyfish and spider venoms should be determined by the amount of venom injected. Higher doses are required for multiple bites, severe symptoms or delayed presentation.\n\n## 1.10 Trauma and injuries\n\nSevere multiple injuries or major trauma are life-threatening problems that children may present with to hospital. Multiple organs and limbs may be affected, and the cumulative effects of these injuries may cause rapid deterioration of the child's condition. Management requires urgent recognition of the life-threatening injuries.\n\nBasic techniques of emergency triage and assessment are most critical in the first hour of the patient's arrival at hospital. When there is more than one life-threatening state, simultaneous treatment of injuries is essential and requires effective teamwork.\n\n### 1.10.1 Primary survey or initial assessment\n\nThe initial rapid assessment, also commonly referred to as 'the primary survey', should identify life-threatening injuries such as:\n\n• airway obstruction\n• chest injuries with breathing difficulty\n• severe external or internal haemorrhage\n• head and cervical spine injuries\n• abdominal injuries.\n\nThe primary survey should be systematic, as described in section 1.2. If there is a risk of neck injury, try to avoid moving the neck, and stabilize as appropriate (see p. 12).\n\nDuring the primary survey, any deterioration in the patient's clinical condition should be managed by reassessment from the start of the protocol; as a previ-\n\n38", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 62, "section": "1.

Young infants (<sub>≤</sub> 2 months) are considered separately (see Chapter 3), as in the IMCI approach.

The symptom-specific chapters give some guidance on questions that should be asked about symptoms, which help in a differential diagnosis of the illness. These include personal, vaccination, family, social and environmental histories. They might lead to important counselling messages, such as sleeping under a bednet for a child with malaria, breastfeeding or sanitary practices for a child with diarrhoea, or reducing exposure to indoor air pollution for a child with pneumonia.\n\nIn younger infants, the history of pregnancy and birth is important. The feeding history of infants and younger children is essential, as this is often when malnutrition begins. For older children, information on development milestones is important. Whereas the history is obtained from a parent or caretaker for younger children, older children can contribute important information. You must establish a rapport with the child and the parent before starting the examination. In general, children between the ages of 8 months and 5 years require the most flexible approach.\n\n## 2.3 Approach to the sick child and clinical examination\n\nAll children must be examined fully, so that no important sign is missed. In contrast to the systematic approach for adults, however, examination of a child should be organized in a way that does not upset the child. The approach to examining children should be flexible. Ideally, you will perform the most 'invasive' part of the examination (e.g. the head and neck examination) last.\n\n* Do not upset the child unnecessarily.\n* Leave the child in the arms of the mother or carer.\n* Observe as many signs as possible before touching the child:\n  - Does the child speak, cry or make any sound?\n  - Is the child alert, interested and looking about?\n  - Does the child appear drowsy?\n\n42", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 66, "section": "2.

Once again, if there is more than one diagnosis or problem, treatment might have to be given together.

YOUNG INFANTS\n\n# ESSENTIAL NEWBORN CARE AT DELIVERY\n\nThis chapter provides guidance on essential newborn care and the management of problems in neonates and young infants, from birth to 2 months of age. It includes neonatal resuscitation, the recognition and management of neonatal sepsis and other bacterial infections, and the management of preterm and low-birth-weight infants. A table giving the doses of commonly used drugs for neonates and young infants is included at the end of this chapter, which also lists the dosages for low-birth-weight and premature infants.\n\n## 3.1 Essential newborn care at delivery\n\nMost newborns require only simple supportive care at and after delivery.\n\n* Dry the infant with a clean towel.\n* Observe the infant while drying (see Chart 12).\n* Maintain the infant in skin-to-skin contact position with the mother.\n* Cover the infant to prevent heat loss.\n* Clamp and cut the cord at least 1 min after birth.\n* Encourage the mother to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour.\n\nSkin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding are the best ways to keep an infant warm and prevent hypoglycaemia. Term and low-birth-weight neonates weighing > 1200 g who do not have complications and are clinically stable should be put in skin-to-skin contact with the mother soon after birth after they have been dried thoroughly to prevent hypothermia.\n\n## 3.2 Neonatal resuscitation\n\nResuscitation may be required for some infants, such as those born to mothers with chronic illness, to mothers who had a previous fetal or neonatal death, to mothers with pre-eclampsia, in multiple pregnancies, in preterm delivery, in abnormal presentation of the fetus, infants with a prolapsed cord, or after prolonged labour, rupture of membranes or meconium-stained liquor.\n\nFor many infants, resuscitation cannot be anticipated before delivery.

Breathing\n\n* Choose a mask size that fits over the nose and mouth (see below): size 1 for normal-weight infant, size 0 for small (< 2.5 kg) infants\n* Ventilate with bag and mask at 40–60 breaths/min.\n* Make sure the chest moves up with each press on the bag; in a very small infant, make sure the chest does not move too much (danger of causing pneumothorax).\n\n### C. Circulation\n\n* Give chest compressions if the heart rate is < 60/min after 30–60 s of ventilation with adequate chest movements: 90 compressions coordinated with 30 breaths/min (three compressions: one breath every 2 s).\n* Place thumbs just below the line connecting the nipples on the sternum (see below).\n* Compress one third the anterior–posterior diameter of the chest.\n\n[Two medical diagrams are shown at the bottom of the page:\n\nLeft diagram: Shows an infant lying on their back with head positioned for airway management and bag-mask ventilation.

{"content": "3. YOUNG INFANTS\n\n3. YOUNG INFANTS\n\n## PRETERM AND LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS\n\n### Feeding\nMany low-birth-weight infants will be able to suckle at the breast. Infants who can suckle should be breastfed. Those who cannot breastfeed should be given expressed breast milk with a cup and spoon. When the infant is sucking well at the breast and gaining weight, reduce the cup feeds. Infants unable to feed from a cup and spoon should be given intermittent bolus feeds through a gastric tube.\n\nFeed the infant only the mother's own milk. In exceptional situations, when this is not possible, donor human milk should be given, if safe milk-banking facilities are available. Formula should be given only if neither of the above is possible.\n\n### Special feeding considerations for infants weighing < 1.5 kg at birth\nThese infants are at the highest risk of feeding problems and necrotizing enterocolitis. The smaller the infant, the higher the risk.\n\n* Starting on the first day, give 10 ml/kg per day of enteral feeds, preferably expressed breast milk, with the remaining fluid requirement at 50 ml/kg per day met by IV fluids. If the infant is well and active and not receiving IV fluids, give 2–4 ml of expressed breast milk every 2 h through a nasogastric tube, depending on the weight of the infant (see p. 57).\n\n* If the infant cannot tolerate enteral feeds, give IV fluids at 60 ml/kg per day for the first day of life. It is best to use a paediatric (100 ml) intravenous burette; 60 drops = 1 ml, therefore one drop per minute = 1 ml/h.\n\n* Check blood sugar every 6 h until enteral feeds are established, especially if the infant is apnoeic, lethargic or convulsing. Very low-birth-weight infants may need a 10% glucose solution. Add 10 ml of 50% glucose to every 90 ml of 4.3% glucose + 0.18% normal saline, or use 10% glucose in water solution.\n\n* Start enteral feeding when the condition of the infant is stable and there is no abdominal distension or tenderness, bowel sounds are present, meconium passed and no apnoea.\n\n* Calculate exact amounts for feeding and the timing of feeds.\n\n* Use a prescription chart.\n\n* Increase daily if well tolerated.\n\n* When commencing milk feeds, start with 2–4 ml every 1–2 h by orogastric or nasogastric tube. Some active very-low-birth-weight infants can be fed with a cup and spoon or an eyedropper, which must be sterilized before each feed. Use only expressed breast milk if possible. If a 2–4-ml volume is tolerated with no vomiting, abdominal distension or gastric aspirates of more than half the feed, the volume can be increased by 1–2 ml per feed\n\n60", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 84, "section": "3.

Caffeine is preferred if it is available.\n\n► The loading dose of caffeine citrate is 20 mg/kg orally or IV (given slowly over 30 min). A maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg per day should be prescribed 24 h later and can be increased by 5 mg/kg every 24 h to a maximum of 20 mg/kg per day, unless side-effects develop. Continue 4–5 days after cessation of apnoea (see p. 69).\n\n► If caffeine is not available, give a loading dose of aminophylline at 6 mg/kg IV over 20 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.5 mg/kg every 12 h (see p. 69).\n\n• If an apnoea monitor is available, this should be used.\n\n• If an apnoea monitor is not available, a pulse oximeter with the alarm turned on for hypoxaemia may help to detect apnoea if the neonate is breathing room air.\n\n### 3.11.3 Common problems of low-birth-weight infants\n\n## Respiratory distress syndrome\n\nPreterm infants are at risk for respiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency. This can be reduced if pregnant mothers at risk for premature delivery (e.g. premature contractions or premature rupture of membranes) are given dexamethasone at two doses of 12 mg 24 h apart. Respiratory distress usually occurs in a preterm infant during the first 3 days of life. It is a self-\n\n61\n\n3.

See section 10.7 for further details.\n\nIf there is persistent respiratory distress or hypoxaemia, do chest X-ray to check for pneumothorax.\n\n## Necrotizing enterocolitis\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (a bowel infection) may occur in low-birth-weight infants, especially after enteral feeds are started. The condition is commoner in low-birth-weight infants fed artificial formulae but may occur in breastfed infants.\n\n*Common signs of necrotizing enterocolitis are:*\n* abdominal distension or tenderness\n* intolerance to feeding\n\n62", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 86, "section": "3.

It is usually not possible to determine the specific cause of pneumonia by clinical features or chest X-ray appearance. Pneumonia is classified as severe or non-severe on the basis of clinical features, the management being based on the classification. Antibiotic therapy should be given in most cases of pneumonia and severe pneumonia. Severe pneumonia may require additional supportive care, such as oxygen, to be given in hospital.\n\n### 4.2.1 Severe pneumonia\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\nCough or difficulty in breathing, plus at least one of the following:\n\n* central cyanosis or oxygen saturation < 90% on pulse oximetry\n* severe respiratory distress (e.g. grunting, very severe chest indrawing)\n* signs of pneumonia with a general danger sign:\n  - inability to breastfeed or drink,\n  - lethargy or unconscious,\n  - convulsions.\n* In addition, some or all of the other signs of pneumonia may be present, such as:\n  - signs of pneumonia\n    • fast breathing: age 2–11 months, ≥ 50/min\n                     age 1–5 years, ≥ 40/min\n  - chest indrawing: lower chest wall indrawing (i.e. lower chest wall goes in when the child breathes in)\n  - chest auscultation signs:\n    • decreased breath sounds\n    • bronchial breath sounds\n    • crackles\n    • abnormal vocal resonance (decreased over a pleural effusion or empyema, increased over lobar consolidation)\n    • pleural rub", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 104, "section": "80"}}

The spread of bacteria can lead to septic shock or metastatic secondary infections like meningitis especially in infants, peritonitis, and endocarditis especially in patients with vulvar heart disease or septic arthritis. Other common complication include pleural effusion, empyema and lung abscess.\n\n### 4.3.1 Pleural effusion and empyema\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nA child with pneumonia may develop pleural effusion or empyema.\n\n* On examination, the chest is dull to percussion, and breath sounds are reduced or absent over the affected area.\n* A pleural rub may be heard at an early stage before the effusion is fully developed.\n* A chest X-ray shows fluid on one or both sides of the chest.\n* When empyema is present, fever persists despite antibiotic therapy, and the pleural fluid is cloudy or frankly purulent.\n\n#### Treatment\n\n**Drainage**\n\n▶ Pleural effusions should be drained, unless they are very small. If effusions are present on both sides of the chest, drain both. It may be necessary to repeat drainage two or three times if fluid returns. See Annex A1.5, p. 348, for guidelines on chest drainage.\n\nSubsequent management depends on the character of the fluid obtained. When possible, pleural fluid should be analysed for protein and glucose content, cell count and differential count, and examined after Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen staining and bacterial and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* culture.\n\n**Antibiotic therapy**\n\n▶ Give ampicillin or cloxacillin or flucloxacillin (50 mg/kg IM or IV every 6 h) and gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM or IV once a day). When the child improves (after at least 7 days of IV or IM antibiotics), continue cloxacillin orally four times a day for a total course of 3 weeks.\n\n**Note:** Cloxacillin is preferable if staphylococcal infection is suspected; it can be replaced by another anti-staphylococcal antibiotic such as oxacillin, flucloxacillin\n\n88", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 112, "section": "COMPLICATIONS OF PNEUMONIA"}}

The development of TB depends on the competence of the immune system to resist multiplication of the *M. tuberculosis* infection. This competence varies with age, being least in the very young. HIV infection and malnutrition lower the body's defenses, and measles and whooping cough temporarily impair the strength of the immune system. In the presence of any of these conditions, TB can develop more easily.\n\nTB is most often severe when it is located in the lungs, meninges or kidney. Cervical lymph nodes, bones, joints, abdomen, ears, eyes and skin may also be affected. Many children present only with failure to grow normally, weight loss or prolonged fever. Cough for > 14 days can also be a presenting sign; in children, however, sputum-positive pulmonary TB is rarely diagnosed.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nThe risk for TB is increased when there is an active case (infectious, smear-positive pulmonary TB) in the same house or when the child is malnourished, has HIV/AIDS or had measles in the past few months.

The underlying causes include congenital heart disease (usually in the first months of life), acute rheumatic fever, cardiac arrhythmia, myocarditis, suppurative pericarditis with constriction, infective endocarditis, acute glomerulonephritis, severe anaemia, severe pneumonia and severe malnutrition. Heart failure can be precipitated or worsened by fluid overload, especially when large volumes of IV fluids are given.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nThe commonest signs of heart failure, on examination, are:\n\n120", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 144, "section": "HEART FAILURE"}}

The main measures for treating heart failure in children who are not severely malnourished are:\n\n* **Oxygen.** Give oxygen if the child has a respiratory rate of ≥ 70/min, shows signs of respiratory distress, or has central cyanosis or low oxygen saturation. Aim to keep oxygen saturation > 90%. See p. 314.\n\n* **Diuretics.** Give furosemide: A dose of 1 mg/kg should increase urine flow within 2 h. For faster action, give the drug IV.

Thereafter, a single daily dose of 1–2 mg/kg orally is usually sufficient.\n\n121\n\nCOUGH\n4.", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 145, "section": "HEART FAILURE"}}

Monitor both respiratory and pulse rates, liver size and body weight to assess the response to treatment. Continue treatment until the respiratory and pulse rates are normal and the liver is no longer enlarged.\n\n## 4.9 Rheumatic heart disease\nChronic rheumatic heart disease is a complication of acute rheumatic fever, which leaves permanent damage to the heart valves (see p. 193). In some children, antibodies produced in response to group A β-haemolytic streptococci lead to varying degrees of pancarditis, with associated valve insufficiency in the acute phase.\n\nThe risk for rheumatic heart disease is higher with repeated episodes of acute rheumatic fever. It leads to valve stenosis, with varying degrees of regurgitation, atrial dilatation, arrhythmia and ventricular dysfunction. Chronic rheumatic heart disease is a major cause of mitral valve stenosis in children.\n\n### Diagnosis\nRheumatic heart disease should be suspected in any child with a previous history of rheumatic fever who presents with heart failure or is found to have a heart murmur. Diagnosis is important because penicillin prophylaxis can prevent further episodes of rheumatic fever and avoid worse damage to the heart valves.\n\nThe presentation depends on the severity.

Assessment of severely malnourished children is described in sections 7.2 and 7.4.3 (pp. 198 and 203). The three essential elements in the management of all children with diarrhoea are **rehydration therapy**, **zinc supplementation** and counselling for **continued feeding and prevention**.\n\nIn diarrhoea, there is excess loss of water, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate) and zinc in liquid stools. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not adequately replaced and there are deficits of water and electrolytes. The degree of dehydration is graded according to symptoms and signs that reflect the amount of fluid lost; see sections 2.3 (p. 43) and 5.2 (p. 127). The rehydration regimen is selected according to the degree of dehydration. All children with diarrhoea should receive zinc supplements.\n\nDuring diarrhoea, decreased food intake and nutrient absorption and increased nutrient requirements often combine to cause weight loss and failure to grow. Malnutrition can make diarrhoea more severe, more prolonged and more frequent than in well-nourished children. This vicious circle can be broken by giving nutrient-rich foods during and continuing after the diarrhoea episode, when the child is well.\n\n125", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 149, "section": "CHAPTER 5"}}

{"content": "SEVERE PERSISTENT DIARRHOEA\n\n# SEVERE PERSISTENT DIARRHOEA\n\nORS solution is effective for most children with persistent diarrhoea. A few children, however, may have impaired glucose absorption, and ORS solution may not be as effective. When these children are given ORS, their stool volume increases markedly, thirst increases, signs of dehydration develop or worsen, and the stools contain a large amount of unabsorbed glucose. These children require IV rehydration until ORS solution can be taken without causing the diarrhoea to worsen.\n\nRoutine treatment of persistent diarrhoea with antibiotics is not effective and should not be done. Some children, however, have non-intestinal or intestinal infections that require specific antibiotic therapy.\n\n* Examine every child with persistent diarrhoea for non-intestinal infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, urinary tract infection, oral thrush and otitis media, and treat appropriately.\n\n* Give micronutrients and vitamins as shown in the box on p. 141.\n\n* Treat persistent diarrhoea with blood in the stools with an oral antibiotic effective for *Shigella*, as described in section 5.4, p. 143.\n\n* Give oral metronidazole at 10 mg/kg three times a day for 5 days only if:\n  - microscopic examination of fresh faeces reveals trophozoites of *Entamoeba histolytica* within red blood cells; **or**\n  - trophozoites or cysts of giardia are seen in the faeces, **or**\n  - two different antibiotics that are usually effective for *Shigella* locally have been given without clinical improvement.\n  - if stool examination is not possible, when diarrhoea persists for > 1 month.\n\n## Feeding\n\nCareful attention to feeding is essential for all children with persistent diarrhoea. Breastfeeding should be continued for as often and as long as the child wants. Other food should be withheld for 4–6 h only for children with dehydration who are being rehydrated following treatment plan B or C.\n\n### Hospital diet\n\nChildren treated in hospital require special diets until their diarrhoea lessens and they are gaining weight. The goal is to give a daily intake of at least 110 calories/kg.\n\n### Infants aged < 6 months\n\n• Encourage exclusive breastfeeding.

{"content": "5. DIARRHOEA\n\n5. DIARRHOEA\n\n## DYSENTERY\n\n### Nutritional management\nEnsuring a good diet is important, as dysentery has a marked adverse effect on nutritional status. Feeding is often difficult because of lack of appetite; return of appetite is an important sign of improvement.\n\n* Breastfeeding should be continued throughout the course of the illness, more frequently than normal, if possible, because the infant may not take the usual amount per feed.\n* Children aged 6 months or more should receive their normal foods. Encourage the child to eat, and allow the child to select preferred foods.\n\n### Complications\n* **Dehydration.** Dehydration is the commonest complication of dysentery, and children should be assessed and managed for dehydration irrespective of any other complication. Give fluids according to treatment plan A, B or C, as appropriate.\n* **Potassium depletion.** Potassium depletion can be prevented by giving ORS solution (when indicated) or potassium-rich foods such as bananas, coconut water or dark-green leafy vegetables.\n* **High fever.** If the child has high fever (≥ 39 °C or ≥ 102.2 °F) that appears to be causing distress, give paracetamol and consider severe bacterial infection.\n* **Rectal prolapse.** Gently push back the rectal prolapse using a surgical glove or a wet cloth. Alternatively, prepare a warm solution of saturated magnesium sulfate, and apply compresses with this solution to reduce the prolapse by decreasing oedema.\n* **Convulsions.** A single convulsion is the commonest finding. If they are prolonged or repeated, give diazepam (see chart 9, p. 15). Avoid giving rectal diazepam. Always check for hypoglycaemia.\n* **Haemolytic uraemic syndrome.** Where laboratory tests are not possible, suspect haemolytic uraemic syndrome in patients with easy bruising, pallor, altered consciousness and low or no urine output.\n* **Toxic megacolon.** Toxic megacolon usually presents with fever, abdominal distension, pain and tenderness with loss of bowel sounds, tachycardia and dehydration. Give IV fluids for dehydration, pass a nasogastric tube, and start antibiotics.\n\nFurther details of treatment can be found in standard paediatric textbooks.\n\n146", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 170, "section": "5.

The illness starts with fever and often vomiting. Children can deteriorate rapidly over 1–2 days, developing complications, the commonest of which are coma (cerebral malaria) or less profound altered level of consciousness, inability to sit up or drink (prostration), convulsions, severe anaemia, respiratory distress (due to acidosis) and hypoglycaemia.\n\n**Diagnosis**\n\n**History.** Children with severe malaria present with some of the clinical features listed below. A change of behaviour, confusion, drowsiness, altered consciousness and generalized weakness are usually indicative of 'cerebral malaria'.\n\n**Examination.** Make a rapid clinical assessment, with special attention to level of consciousness, blood pressure, rate and depth of respiration and pallor. Assess neck stiffness and examine for rash to exclude alternative diagnoses. The main features indicative of severe malaria are:\n\nⓤ generalized multiple convulsions: more than two episodes in 24 h\nⓤ impaired consciousness, including unrousable coma\nⓤ generalized weakness (prostration) or lethargy, i.e. the child is unable walk or sit up without assistance\nⓤ deep laboured breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing)\nⓤ pulmonary oedema (or radiological evidence)\nⓤ abnormal bleeding\nⓤ clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction\nⓤ severe pallor\n\n156", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 180, "section": "MALARIA"}}

Check blood glucose in all children with signs suggesting severe malaria.\n\n• hyperparasitaemia (thick blood smears and thin blood smear if species identification required). Hyperparasitaemia > 100 000/μl (2.5%) in low-intensity transmission areas or 20% hyperparasitaemia in areas of high transmission. Where microscopy is not feasible or may be delayed, a positive rapid diagnostic test is diagnostic.\n\n• severe anaemia (eryththrocyte volume fraction [EVF], < 15%; Hb, < 5 g/dl)\n\n• high blood lactate (> 5 mmol/litre)\n\n• high serum creatinine (renal impairment, creatinine >265 umol/l)\n\n• lumbar puncture to exclude bacterial meningitis in a child with severe malaria and altered level of consciousness or in coma. A lumbar puncture should be done if there are no contraindications (see p. 346). If lumbar puncture is delayed and bacterial meningitis cannot be excluded, give antibiotic treatment in addition to antimalarial treatment (see p. 169).\n\nIf severe malaria is suspected and the initial blood smear is negative, perform a rapid diagnostic test, if available. If the test is positive, treat for severe malaria but continue to look for other causes of severe illness (including severe bacterial infections). If the rapid diagnostic test is negative, malaria is unlikely to be the cause of illness, and an alternative diagnosis must be sought.\n\n## Treatment\n\n### Emergency measures, to be taken within the first hour\n\n► If the child is unconscious, minimize the risk for aspiration pneumonia by inserting a nasogastric tube and removing the gastric contents by suction. Keep the airway open, and place in recovery position.\n\n► Check for hypoglycaemia and correct, if present (see p. 161). If blood glucose cannot be measured and hypoglycaemia is suspected, give glucose.\n\n► Treat convulsions with rectal or IV diazepam (see Chart 9, p. 15). Do not give prophylactic anticonvulsants.\n\n► Start treatment with an effective antimalarial agent (see below).\n\n► If hyperpyrexia is present, give paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce temperature below 39 °C.\n\n157", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 181, "section": "SEVERE MALARIA"}}

If it is not available, parenteral artemether or quinine should be used. Give antimalarial agents by the parenteral route until the child can take oral medication or for a minimum of 24 h even if the patient can tolerate oral medication earlier.\n\n* **Artesunate:** Give artesunate at 2.4 mg/kg IV or IM on admission, then at 12 h and 24 h, then daily until the child can take oral medication but for a minimum of 24 h even if the child can tolerate oral medication earlier.\n\n* **Quinine:** Give a loading dose of quinine dihydrochloride salt at 20 mg/kg by infusion in 10 ml/kg of IV fluid over 2–4 h. Then, 8 h after the start of the loading dose, give 10 mg/kg quinine salt in IV fluid over 2 h, and repeat every 8 h until the child can take oral medication. The infusion rate should not exceed a total of 5 mg/kg per h of quinine dihydrochloride salt.\n\nIV quinine should **never** be given as a bolus injection but as a 2–4 h infusion under close nursing supervision. If IV quinine infusion is not possible, quinine dihydrochloride can be given as a diluted divided IM injection. Give the loading dose split into two as 10 mg/kg of quinine salt into the anterior aspect of each thigh. Then, continue with 10 mg/kg every 8 h until oral medication is tolerated. The diluted parenteral solution is better absorbed and less painful.\n\n* **Artemether:** Give artemether at 3.2 mg/kg IM on admission, then 1.6 mg/kg daily until the child can take oral medication. Use a 1-ml tuberculin syringe to give the small injection volume. As absorption of artemether may be erratic, it should be used only if artesunate or quinine is not available.\n\nGive parenteral antimalarial agent for the treatment of severe malaria for at least 24 h; thereafter, complete treatment with a full course of artemisinin-based combination therapy, such as:\n\n• artemether–lumefantrine\n• artesunate plus amodiaquine\n\n158", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 182, "section": "6.

The most reliable sign of fluid overload is an enlarged liver. Additional signs are gallop rhythm, fine crackles at lung bases and fullness of neck veins when upright. Eyelid oedema is a useful sign of fluid overload.\nIf, after careful rehydration, the urine output over 24 h is < 4 ml/kg, give IV furosemide, initially at 2 mg/kg. If there is no response, double the dose at hourly intervals to a maximum of 8 mg/kg (given over 15 min). Large doses should be given once to avoid possible nephrotoxicity.\n\n*For an unconscious child:*\n► Maintain clear airway.\n► Nurse the child in recovery position or 30° head-up to avoid aspiration of fluids.\n► Insert a nasogastric tube for feeding and to minimize the risk of aspiration.\n► Turn the patient every 2 h.\n• Do not allow the child to lie in a wet bed.\n• Pay attention to pressure points.\n\n## Complications\n*Coma (cerebral malaria)*\nThe earliest symptom of cerebral malaria is usually a brief (1–2-day) history of fever, followed by inability to eat or drink preceding a change in behaviour or altered level of consciousness.

The recommended dexamethasone dose in bacterial meningitis is 0.15 mg/kg every 6 h for 2–4 days. Steroids should be given within 10–20 min before or during administration of antibiotics.

Septicaemia can also occur as a complication of meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection or any other bacterial infection. The common causative agents include *Streptococcus*, *Haemophilus influenza*, *Staphylococcus aureus* and enteric Gram-negative bacilli (which are common in severe malnutrition), such as *Escherichia coli* and *Klebsiella*.

If swelling recurs repeatedly after aspiration, or if the infection responds poorly to 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment, exploration, drainage of pus and excision of any dead bone should be done by a surgeon. In the case of septic arthritis, open drainage may be required. The duration of antibiotic treatment should be extended in these circumstances to 6 weeks.\n* Tuberculous osteomyelitis is suggested by a history of slow onset of swelling and a chronic course, which does not respond well to the above treatment.

Excess fluid will be reabsorbed and lost through urinary diuresis.\n\n## Supportive care\n\n- Treat high fever with paracetamol if the child is uncomfortable. Do not give aspirin or NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, as they aggravate the bleeding.\n- Do not give steroids.\n- Convulsions are not common in children with severe dengue. If they occur, manage as outlined in Chart 9, p. 15.\n- If the child is unconscious, follow the guidelines in section 1.5.3, p. 23.\n- Children in shock or with respiratory distress should receive oxygen, if possible with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (see above).\n- Hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 2.5 mmol/litre or < 45 mg/dl) is unusual. If present, give IV glucose as described in Chart 10, p. 16.\n- If the child has severe hepatic involvement, see standard paediatric textbook for guidelines.\n\n192", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 216, "section": "6.

A doctor should review the patient at least four times a day and prescribe IV fluids for a maximum of 6 h at a time.\n* For children without shock, a nurse should check the child's vital signs (temperature, pulse and blood pressure) at least four times a day and the EVF once daily, and a doctor should review the patient at least once daily.\n* Check the platelet count daily, when possible in the acute phase.\n* Keep a detailed record of all fluid intake and output.\n\n## 6.11 Rheumatic fever\n\nRheumatic fever commonly follows S. pyogenes infection of the throat or skin. Some children present with fever and pains in the large joints, which may move from one joint to another. The infection can damage the heart valves (especially the mitral and aortic valves), leading to respiratory distress and heart failure. Children with mild disease may have only a heart murmur. Severe disease can present with fever, fast or difficult breathing and lethargy. The child may have chest pain or fainting. Affected children are usually > 5 years of age. Those that present with heart failure have a rapid heart rate, respiratory distress and an enlarged liver.\n\n### Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of rheumatic fever is important because penicillin prophylaxis can prevent further episodes and avoid worsening damage to the heart valves.\n\nAcute rheumatic fever is diagnosed clinically by WHO criteria based on the revised Jones criteria (Table 20). The diagnosis is based on two major or one major and two minor manifestations plus evidence of a previous group A streptococcal infection.\n\n### Investigations\n\nDiagnosis of rheumatic fever requires evidence of a prior streptococcal infection.\n\n* Streptococcal serum antibody tests (antistreptolysin-O test and antideoxyribonclease B test)\n* acute-phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein)\n* full blood count\n\n193", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 217, "section": "RHEUMATIC FEVER"}}

No distinction is made between the clinical conditions of kwashiorkor or severe wasting because their treatment is similar.\n\nChildren who are <-3SD weight-for-age may be stunted (short stature) but not severely wasted. Stunted children who are not severely wasted do not require hospital admission unless they have a serious illness.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nThe main diagnostic features are:\n\n* weight-for-length/height < -3SD (wasted) (see p. 386) or\n* mid-upper arm circumference < 115 mm or  \n* oedema of both feet (kwashiorkor with or without severe wasting).\n\nChildren with severe acute malnutrition should first be assessed with a full clinical examination to confirm whether they have any general danger sign, medical complications and an appetite.\n\nChildren with severe acute malnutrition with loss of appetite or any medical complication have **complicated severe acute malnutrition** and should be admitted for inpatient care. Children who have a good appetite and no medical complications can be managed as outpatients.\n\n[The page includes a medical illustration showing a severely malnourished child sitting cross-legged, displaying the characteristic features of marasmus including visible ribs, thin limbs, and wasted appearance.

Assume that all children with watery diarrhoea or reduced urine output have some dehydration. It is important to note that poor circulatory volume or perfusion can co-exist with oedema.\n\n## Treatment\n\nDo not use the IV route for rehydration, except in cases of shock (see p. 14). Rehydrate slowly, either orally or by nasogastric tube, using oral rehydration solution for malnourished children (5–10ml/kg per h up to a maximum of 12 hours). The standard WHO ORS solution for general use has a high sodium and low potassium content, which is not suitable for severely malnourished children. Instead, give special rehydration solution for malnutrition, ReSoMal.\n\n* Give the ReSoMal rehydration fluid orally or by nasogastric tube, more slowly than you would when rehydrating a well-nourished child:\n  - Give 5 ml/kg every 30 min for the first 2 h.\n  - Then give 5–10 ml/kg per h for the next 4–10 h on alternate hours, with F-75 formula. The exact amount depends on how much the child wants, the volume of stool loss and whether the child is vomiting.\n\n* If not available then give half strength standard WHO oral rehydration solution with added potassium and glucose as per the ReSoMal recipe below, unless the child has cholera or profuse watery diarrhoea.\n\n* If rehydration is still required at 10 h, give starter F-75 (see recipes on pp. 212–3) instead of ReSoMal, at the same times.

If neither is available, 0.45% saline with 5% dextrose should be used (see Chart 8, p. 14)\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDuring rehydration, respiration and pulse rate should fall and urine start to be passed. The return of tears, a moist mouth, less sunken eyes and fontanelle, and improved skin turgor are also signs that rehydration is proceeding, but many severely malnourished children will not show these changes even when fully rehydrated. Monitor weight gain.\n\nMonitor the progress of rehydration every 30 min for 2 h, then every hour for the next 4–10 h. Be alert for signs of overhydration, which is very dangerous and may lead to heart failure. Check for:\n\n• weight gain to ensure that it is not quick and excessive.\n\n204", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 228, "section": "7. MALNUTRITION"}}

Giving high sodium loads could kill the child.\n\n### Treatment\n\n► Give extra potassium (3–4 mmol/kg per day).\n► Give extra magnesium (0.4–0.6 mmol/kg per day).\n\nThe extra potassium and magnesium should be added to the feed during its preparation if not pre-mixed. See p. 205 for a recipe for a combined electrolyte/mineral solution. Add 20 ml of this solution to 1 litre of feed to supply the extra potassium and magnesium required.

Therefore, assume that all children with severe acute malnutrition have an infection on their arrival in hospital, and treat with antibiotics immediately. Hypoglycaemia and hypothermia are often signs of severe infection.\n\n### Treatment\n\nGive all severely malnourished children:\n* a broad-spectrum antibiotic\n* measles vaccine if the child is ≥ 6 months and not vaccinated or was vaccinated before 9 months age. Delay vaccination if the child is in shock.\n\n### Choice of broad-spectrum antibiotics\n\n* If the child has uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition, give oral amoxicillin (for dosage, see p. 356) for 5 days.\n* If there are complications (hypoglycaemia, hypothermia or the child looks lethargic or sickly) or any other medical complication, give parenteral antibiotics:\n  - benzylpenicillin (50 000 U/kg IM or IV every 6 h) or ampicillin (50 mg/kg IM or IV every 6 h) for 2 days, then oral amoxicillin (25–40 mg/kg every 8 h for 5 days)\n  \n  plus\n  \n  - gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg IM or IV) once a day for 7 days.\n\nThese regimens should be adapted to local resistance patterns.\n\n**Note:** Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg every 8 h for 7 days may be given in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, the efficacy of this treatment has not been established in clinical trials.\n\n* Treat other infections as appropriate:\n  - If meningitis is suspected, do a lumbar puncture for confirmation, where possible, and treat with the antibiotic regime (section 6.3.1, p. 169).\n  - If you identify other specific infections (such as pneumonia, dysentery, skin or soft-tissue infections), give antibiotics as appropriate.\n  - Add antimalarial treatment if the child has a positive blood film for malaria parasites or a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test.\n\n207", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 231, "section": "INFECTION                                                    7.

Give albendazole as a single dose or mebendazole 100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days. In countries where infestation is prevalent, also give mebendazole to children with no evidence of infestation 7 days after admission.\n\n**HIV infection**\nWhere HIV infection is common, children with severe acute malnutrition should be tested for HIV to determine their need for antiretroviral therapy (ART). If the child is infected with HIV, start ART as soon as possible after stabilization of metabolic complications and sepsis. They should be monitored closely (inpatient and outpatient) in the first 6–8 weeks following initiation of ART to identify early metabolic complications and opportunistic infections (see Chapter 8).\n\n**Monitoring**\nIf the child is still anorexic after 7 days of antibiotic treatment, continue for a full 10-day course. If anorexia persists, reassess the child fully.\n\n### 7.4.6 Micronutrient deficiencies\n\nAll severely malnourished children have vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Although anaemia is common, do not give iron initially, but wait until the child has a good appetite and starts gaining weight (usually in the second week), because iron can make infections worse.\n\nMultivitamins including vitamin A and folic acid, zinc and copper are already present in F-75, F-100 and ready-to-use therapeutic food packets. When premixed packets are used, there is no need for additional doses.\n\nIn addition, if there are no eye signs or history of measles, then do not give a high dose of vitamin A because the amounts already present in therapeutic foods are enough.\n\n**Treatment**\n► Give vitamin A on day 1 and repeat on days 2 and 14 only if child has any signs of vitamin A deficiency like corneal ulceration or a history of measles (see section 7.5.1, p. 217).\n\n208", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 232, "section": "7.

An organic cause for the malnutrition or failure to thrive should be considered, and, when appropriate, treated. Infants less than 6 months of age with severe acute malnutrition with any of the following complicating factors should be admitted for inpatient care:\n\n* general danger signs or serious clinical condition as outlined for infants 6 months or older.\n* recent weight loss or failure to gain weight.\n* ineffective breastfeeding (attachment, positioning or suckling) directly observed for 15–20 min, ideally in a supervised separated area.\n* any pitting bilateral oedema of the feet.\n* any medical problem needing more detailed assessment\n* any social issue requiring detailed assessment or intensive support (e.g. disability or depression of caretaker or other adverse social circumstances).\n\n### Treatment\n\n► Admit infants with any of the above complicating factors.\n\n► Give parenteral antibiotics to treat possible sepsis, and appropriate treatment for other medical complications.\n\n► Re-establish effective exclusive breastfeeding by the mother or other caregiver. If not possible, give replacement commercial infant formula with advice on safe preparation and use.\n\n► For infants with severe acute malnutrition and oedema, give infant formula or F-75 or diluted F-100 (add water to formula on p. 212 up to 1.5 litres instead of 1 litre) to supplement breastfeeding.\n\n► For infants with severe acute malnutrition with no oedema, give expressed breast milk; and when not possible, commercial infant formula or F-75 or diluted F-100, in this order of preference.\n\nDuring nutritional rehabilitation, the basic principles for older children apply; however, young infants are less able to excrete salt and urea in their urine, especially in hot climates. Therefore, the preferred diets in the stabilization phase are (in order of preference):\n\n* breast milk (if available in sufficient quantity)\n* commercial infant formula\n\n216", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 240, "section": "7.

Thus, if mid-upper arm circumference was used, then it should be used to assess and confirm nutritional recovery, and similarly for weight for length/height.

HIV/AIDS\n\n# SICK CHILD WITH SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED HIV INFECTION\n\nIn general, the management of specific conditions in HIV-infected children is similar to that in other children (see Chapters 3–7). Most infections in HIV-positive children are caused by the same pathogens as in HIV-negative children, although they may be more frequent, more severe and occur repeatedly. Some, infections, however, are due to unusual pathogens.\n\nMany HIV-positive children die from common childhood illnesses, and some of these deaths are preventable by early diagnosis and correct management or by giving routine scheduled vaccinations and improving nutrition. These children have a particularly greater risk for staphylococcal and pneumococcal infections and TB. Saving children's lives depends on early identification, immediate treatment with ART and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for those who are HIV-infected.\n\nAll infants and children should have their HIV status established at their first contact with the health system, ideally at birth or at the earliest opportunity thereafter. To facilitate this, all areas of the hospital in which maternal, neonatal and child services are delivered should offer HIV serological testing to mothers and their infants and children.\n\nThis chapter covers mainly the management of children with HIV/AIDS: diagnosis of HIV infection, counselling and testing, clinical staging, ART, management of HIV-related conditions, supportive care, breastfeeding, planning discharge and follow-up and palliative care for terminally ill children.\n\n## 8.1 Sick child with suspected or confirmed HIV infection\n\n### 8.1.1 Clinical diagnosis\n\nThe clinical expression of HIV infection in children is highly variable. Many HIV-positive children show severe HIV-related signs and symptoms in the first year of life, while others may remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic for more than a year and may survive for several years.\n\nClinical experience indicates that children infected with HIV perinatally who are not on antiretroviral therapy fit into one of three categories:\n\n* those with rapid progression (25–30%), most of whom die before their first birthday; they are thought to have acquired the infection in utero or during the early postnatal period;\n\n* children who develop symptoms early in life, then follow a downhill course and die at the age of 3–5 years (50–60%);\n\n* long-term survivors, who live beyond 8 years of age (5–25%); they tend to have lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis and stunting, with low weight and height for age.\n\n226", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 250, "section": "8.

Suspect HIV particularly in breastfed infants < 6 months old who fail to thrive.\n\n### 8.1.2 HIV counselling\n\nHIV provider-initiated testing and counselling should be offered to all children attending clinical services in countries with generalized HIV epidemics (prevalence over 1% in pregnant women). If the child's HIV status is not known, counsel the family and offer diagnostic testing for HIV.\n\nAs the majority of children are infected by vertical transmission from the mother, the mother and often the father are probably infected but may not know it. Even in countries with a high prevalence of HIV infection, it remains an extremely stigmatizing condition, and the parents may feel reluctant to undergo testing.\n\nIn HIV counselling, the child should be treated as part of the family by taking into account the psychological implications of HIV for the child, mother, father and other family members. Counsellors should stress that, although there is no definitive cure, early initiation of ART and supportive care can greatly improve the child's and the parents' quality of life and survival.\n\nCounselling requires time and must be done by trained staff. If there are no trained staff, assistance should be sought from local AIDS support organizations. HIV testing should be voluntary, with no coercion, and informed consent should be obtained before testing is performed.\n\n#### Indications for HIV counselling and testing\n\nAll infants and children in countries with generalized HIV epidemics with unknown HIV status should be offered counselling and testing. In most cases, the HIV status of the child is established by asking about maternal HIV testing during pregnancy, labour or postpartum and checking the child's or mother's health card. If the HIV status is not known, counselling and testing should be offered in the following situations to:\n\n• all infants and children in generalized HIV epidemic settings (prevalence > 1% in pregnant women).\n\n228", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 252, "section": "8.

Additional diagnostic challenges arise if the child is still breastfeeding or has been breastfed. Although many children will have lost HIV antibodies between 9 and 18 months, a virological test is the only reliable method for determining the HIV status of a child < 18 months of age.\n\nWhen either the mother or the child has a positive serological HIV test and the child has specific symptoms suggestive of HIV infection but virological testing is not available, the child may presumptively be diagnosed as having HIV infection. However, HIV virological testing should be done at the earliest opportunity to confirm infection.\n\nAll diagnostic HIV testing of children must be confidential, be accompanied by counselling and conducted only with informed consent, so that it is both informed and voluntary.\n\n### HIV serological antibody test (ELISA or rapid tests)\n\nRapid tests are widely available, sensitive and reliable for diagnosing HIV infection in children > 18 months. For children < 18 months, HIV antibody tests are a sensitive, reliable way of detecting exposure and of excluding HIV infection in non-breastfeeding children.\n\nRapid HIV tests can be used to exclude HIV infection in a child presenting with severe acute malnutrition, or TB or any other serious clinical event in areas of high HIV prevalence. For children aged < 18 months, confirm all positive HIV serological results by virological testing as soon as possible (see below). When this is not possible, repeat antibody testing at 18 months.\n\n### Virological tests\n\nVirological testing for HIV-specific RNA or DNA is the most reliable method for diagnosing HIV infection in children < 18 months of age. This may require sending a blood sample to a specialized laboratory that can perform this test, although virological testing is becoming more widely available in many countries. The tests are relatively cheap, easy to standardize and can be done\n\n229", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 253, "section": "TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS OF HIV INFECTION\n\n• all HIV-exposed infants at birth or at the earliest opportunity thereafter.\n• any infant or child presenting with signs, symptoms or medical conditions that could indicate HIV infection.\n• all pregnant women and their partners in generalized HIV epidemics."}}

The following assays (and respective specimen types) may be available:\n\n• HIV DNA on whole blood specimen or dried blood spots\n• HIV RNA on plasma or dried blood spots\n• ultrasensitive p24 antigen detection in plasma or dried blood spots\n\nOne positive virological test at 4–8 weeks is sufficient to diagnose HIV infection in a young infant. ART should be started without delay, and, at the same time, a second specimen should be collected to confirm the positive virological test result.\n\nIf the infant is still breastfeeding and the virological test is negative, it should be repeated 6 weeks after complete cessation of breastfeeding to confirm that the child is not infected with HIV.\n\nThe results of virological testing in infants should be returned to the clinic and to the child, mother or carer as soon as possible but at the very latest within 4 weeks of specimen collection.\n\n### Diagnosing HIV infection in breastfeeding infants\n\nA breastfeeding infant is at risk of acquiring HIV infection from an infected mother throughout the period of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should not be stopped in order to perform diagnostic HIV viral testing. Positive test results should be considered to reflect HIV infection. The interpretation of negative results is, however, difficult because a 6-week period after complete cessation of breastfeeding is required before negative viral test results can reliably indicate HIV infection status.\n\n### 8.1.4 Clinical staging\n\nIn a child with diagnosed or highly suspected HIV infection, the clinical staging system helps to determine the degree of damage to the immune system and to plan treatment and care.\n\nThe clinical stages represent a progressive sequence from least to most severe, each higher clinical stage indicating a poorer prognosis. Initiating ART, with good adherence, dramatically improves the prognosis. Clinical staging events can be used to identify the response to ART if there is no easy access to tests for viral load or CD4 count.\n\n230", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 254, "section": "8.

Although antiretroviral drugs cannot cure HIV infection, they dramatically reduce mortality and morbidity and improve the children's quality of life.\n\nThe current standard first-line treatment for HIV infection is use of three antiretroviral medications (triple drug therapy) to suppress viral replication as much as possible and thus arrest the progression of HIV disease. Fixed-dose combinations are now available and are preferable to syrups or single drugs because they encourage adherence to treatment, and reduce the cost.\n\nClinicians should be familiar with the national paediatric HIV treatment guidelines. The underlying principles of ART and the choice of first-line drugs for children are largely the same as for adults. Suitable formulations for children may not be available for some antiretroviral drugs (particularly the protease inhibitor class). It is nevertheless important to consider:\n\n• the availability of a suitable formulation that can be taken in appropriate doses\n• the simplicity of the dosage schedule\n\n232", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 256, "section": "8.

When viral load monitoring is available, consideration can be given to substituting LPV/r with an NNRTI after virological suppression is sustained.\n\nFor children ≥ 3 years efavirenz (EFV) is the preferred NNRTI for first-line treatment particularly once daily therapy, although NVP may be used as an alternative especially for children who are on twice daily therapy. Efavirenz is also the NNRTI of choice in children who are on rifampicin, if treatment has to start before anti-TB therapy is completed.\n\nFor drug dosages and regimens see Annex 2, pp. 370–3.\n\n### Calculation of drug dosages\n\nIn general, children metabolize protease inhibitor and NNRTI drugs faster than adults and therefore require higher equivalent doses to achieve appropriate drug levels. Drug doses must be increased as the child grows; otherwise, there is a risk for under-dosage and the development of resistance.\n\nDrug dosages are given on pp. 370–4, per kilogram of body weight for some drugs and per surface area of the child for others. A table listing the equivalent weights of various surface area values is given in Annex 2 (p. 354) to help in calculating dosages. The use of weight bands for paediatric dosing has also simplified treatment regimens.\n\n### Formulations\n\nDosing in children is usually based on either body surface area or weight, or, **more conveniently, on weight bands**. As these change with growth, drug doses must be adjusted in order to avoid the risk for under-dosage.\n\n233", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 257, "section": "ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS\n\n• the taste and palatability, and hence compliance, for young children.\n\nIt is also important to ensure that HIV-infected parents access treatment; and ART should ideally be ensured for other family members."}}

This is the result of either the unmasking of latent or subclinical infection or the reactivation of previously diagnosed, and often treated, conditions (infectious or non-infectious).\n\nThe onset of IRIS in children usually occurs within the first weeks to months after initiation of ART and is seen most often in children who initiate ART with very low percentage CD4+ levels (< 15%). The commonest opportunistic infections associated with IRIS in children include:\n\n* TB the commonest;\n* pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or cryptosporidiosis;\n* herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection;\n* fungal, parasitic or other infections.\n\nWhere BCG immunization of infants and children is routine, BCG-associated IRIS (localized and systemic) is frequently observed.\n\nMost cases of paradoxical IRIS resolve spontaneously, or can be managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although some episodes can be severe and even lead to death.\n\n▶ Give specific treatment for the opportunistic infection\n\n▶ Start on anti-inflammatory therapy.\n\nOccasionally, IRIS becomes progressively worse and may require a short course of treatment with corticosteroids and, rarely, temporary discontinuation of ART. The same ART regimen should be restarted once IRIS has improved.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn addition to checking for ART side effects, a clinical assessment should be made of the child's or caregiver's adherence to therapy and the need for additional support. The frequency of clinical monitoring depends on the response to ART. At a minimum, after the start of ART, follow-up visits should be made:\n\n* for infants < 12 months, at weeks 2, 4 and 8 and then every 4 weeks for the first year\n* for children > 12 months, at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 and then every 2–3 months once the child has stabilized on ART\n\n237", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 261, "section": "SIDE-EFFECTS AND MONITORING"}}

Older children should eat varied, energy-rich food to increase their energy intake and to ensure adequate micronutrient intake.\n\nChildren should be assessed routinely for nutritional status, including weight and height, at scheduled visits. Their energy intake might have to be increased by 25–30% if they lose weight or grow poorly.\n\nHIV-infected children who have severe acute malnutrition should be managed according to the guidelines for uninfected children and given 50–100% additional energy-rich foods (see Chapter 7, p. 197).\n\n## 8.4 Management of HIV-related conditions\n\nThe treatment of most infections (such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis) in HIV-infected children is the same as in other children.

Early in HIV infection, when immunity is not impaired, the signs of TB are similar to those in a child without HIV infection. Pulmonary TB is still the commonest form of TB, even in HIV-infected children. As HIV infection progresses and immunity declines, dissemination of TB becomes more common, and tuberculous meningitis, miliary TB and widespread tuberculous lymphadenopathy occur.\n\nHIV-infected infants and children with active TB should begin TB treatment immediately.

In addition, they need regular clinical follow-up at first-level facilities to monitor their:\n\n- clinical condition\n- growth\n- nutritional intake\n- vaccination status\n\nThey should also be given psychosocial support, if possible in community programmes.\n\n## 8.7 Palliative and end-of-life care\n\nAn HIV-infected, immunologically compromised child often has considerable discomfort, so good palliative care is essential. All decisions should be taken with the parents or caretaker, and the decisions should be clearly communicated to other staff (including night staff). Consider palliative care at home as an alternative to hospital care. Some treatments for pain control and relief of distressing conditions (such as oesophageal candidiasis or convulsions) can significantly improve the quality of the child's remaining life.\n\nGive end-of-life (terminal) care if:\n\n- the child has progressively worsening illness\n- everything possible has been done to treat the presenting illness.\n\nEnsuring that the family has appropriate support to cope with the impending death of the child is an important part of care in the terminal stages of HIV/AIDS. Parents should be supported in their efforts to give palliative care at home so that the child is not kept in hospital unnecessarily.\n\n### 8.7.1 Pain control\n\nThe management of pain in HIV-infected children follows the same principles as for other chronic diseases, such as cancer and sickle-cell disease. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the care is culturally appropriate and sensitive.\n\n• Give analgesics in two steps according to whether the pain is mild or moderate-to-severe.\n\n250", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 274, "section": "PALLIATIVE AND END-OF-LIFE CARE"}}

For children < 3 months of age, use only paracetamol.\n  – paracetamol at 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 h\n  – ibuprofen at 5–10 mg/kg every 6–8 h\n\n**Moderate-to-severe pain** and pain that does not respond to the above treatment: strong opioids\n\n► Give morphine orally or IV every 4–6 h or by continuous IV infusion\n\n► If morphine does not adequately relieve the pain, then switch to alternative opioids, such as fentanyl or hydromorphone.\n\n*Note: Monitor carefully for respiratory depression. If tolerance develops, the dose should be increased to maintain the same degree of pain relief.*\n\n**Adjuvant medicines:** There is no sufficient evidence that adjuvant therapy relieves persistent pain or specific types such as neuropathic pain, bone pain and pain associated with muscle spasm in children. Commonly used drugs include diazepam for muscle spasm, carbamazepine for neuralgic pain and corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone) for pain due to an inflammatory swelling pressing on a nerve.\n\n## Pain control for procedures and painful lesions in the skin or mucosa\n\n**Local anaesthetics:** during painful procedures, lidocaine should be infiltrated at 1–2%; for painful lesions in the skin or mucosa:\n\n► lidocaine: apply (with gloves) on a gauze pad to painful mouth ulcers before feeds; acts within 2–5 min\n\n► tetracaine, adrenaline and cocaine: apply to a gauze pad and place over open wounds; particularly useful during suturing\n\n251", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 275, "section": "PAIN CONTROL"}}

This chapter provides guidelines for the supportive care of children with surgical problems and briefly describes the management of the commonest surgical conditions. Detailed surgical and anaesthesia guidance can be found in the WHO manual *Surgical care in the district hospital*¹ or the toolkit for integrated management for emergency and essential surgical care.\n\n### 9.1 Care before, during and after surgery\n\nGood surgical care neither begins nor ends with the procedure. In most instances, it is the preparation for surgery, the anaesthetic and the postoperative care that ensure a good outcome.\n\n#### 9.1.1 Preoperative care\n\nBoth the child and the parents should be prepared for the procedure and must consent.\n\n• Explain why the procedure is needed, the anticipated outcome and the potential risks and benefits.\n\n• Ensure that the child is medically fit for an operation:\n  - Correct any fluid deficit and resuscitate as appropriate before an emergency procedure (IV bolus of normal saline, 10–20 ml/kg, repeated as needed). Restoration of urine output implies adequate volume resuscitation.\n  - Correct anaemia. Severe anaemia interferes with oxygen transport. As a consequence, the heart must pump more blood. Surgery may cause blood loss, and the anaesthetic may affect oxygen transport in the blood. Ideally, the child's Hb should be checked to ensure that it is normal for the age and population.\n    • Reserve blood transfusions for situations in which anaemia must be corrected quickly, e.g. emergency surgery.\n    • In children undergoing elective surgery, correct anaemia with oral medications (p. 364).\n    • Children with haemoglobinopathy (HbSS, HbAS, HbSC and thalassaemias) who require surgery and anaesthesia need special care. Refer to standard texts of paediatrics for details.\n\n----\n\n¹ World Health Organization. *Surgical care at the district hospital*.

Oral paracetamol can be given several hours before the operation or rectally at the completion of surgery.\n* Severe pain\n  ▶ Give IV narcotic analgesics (IM injections are painful)\n  – Morphine sulfate, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg IV every 2–4 h\n\n### Nutrition\nMany surgical conditions increase caloric needs or prevent adequate nutritional intake. Many children with surgical problems present in a debilitated state. Poor nutrition adversely affects their response to injury and delays wound healing.\n* Feed children as soon as possible after surgery.\n* Provide a high-calorie diet containing adequate protein and vitamin supplements.\n* Consider feeding by nasogastric tube for children whose oral intake is poor.\n* Monitor the child's weight.\n\n### Prevention of complications\n* Encourage early mobilization:\n  – deep breathing and coughing\n  – active daily exercise\n* Move joints passively\n  – muscular strengthening\n  – provide walking aids, such as canes, crutches and walkers, with instructions for their use\n* Prevent skin breakdown and pressure sores:\n  – Turn the patient frequently.\n  – Keep urine and faeces off skin.\n\n262", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 286, "section": "9.

Whenever possible, try to prevent childhood injuries.\n\n* See Chapter 1, section 1.10, p. 38 for guidelines for assessing children with severe injuries. More detailed surgical guidance is given in the WHO manual *Surgical care in the district hospital*.\n\n### 9.3.1 Burns\n\nBurns and scalds result in high mortality in children. Other injuries might also have occurred, depending on the type of burn, such as from inhaled hot gases. Children who survive may suffer from disfigurement and psychological trauma as a result of a painful, prolonged stay in the hospital.\n\n**Assessment**\n\nBurns may be partial or full thickness. A full-thickness burn involves destruction of the entire thickness of the skin, and the skin will not regenerate. Ask two questions:\n\nHow deep is the burn?\n* Full thickness burns are black or white, usually dry, have no sensation and do not blanch on pressure.\n* Partial thickness burns are pink or red, blistering or weeping and painful.\n\nHow much of the body is burnt?\n* Use a body surface area chart below according to age.\n* Alternatively, use the child's palm to estimate the burnt area. A child's palm represents approximately 1% of the total body surface area.\n\n**Treatment**\n\n* Admit all children with burns covering > 10% of their body surface; those involving the face, hands, feet, perineum and joints; those that are circumferential and those that cannot be managed in an outpatient ward.\n\n* Initially, burns are sterile. Focus treatment on speedy healing and prevention of infection.\n\n* Consider whether the child has a respiratory injury due to smoke inhalation.\n  - If there is evidence of respiratory distress, provide supplementary oxygen (p. 312), and ensure the airway are safe and remain safe by regular observation.

The ribs usually become fairly stable within 10 days to 2 weeks, and firm healing with callus formation is seen after 4–6 weeks in children.\n\n## 9.3.4 Abdominal injuries\nThe abdomen is commonly injured in cases of multiple trauma. Blunt and penetrating trauma to the abdomen may injure a variety of organs. Splenic injuries from blunt trauma and liver injuries from penetrating trauma are especially common. Any child involved in a serious accident should be considered to have an abdominal injury until proven otherwise. Severe abdominal injuries are life-threatening because they can cause severe internal blood loss.\n\n* Assume that a penetrating wound to the abdominal wall has entered the abdominal cavity and that there may be injuries to the intra-abdominal organs. Any penetration of the bowel wall will lead to peritonitis in a day or two, and surgical intervention is essential.\n\n* Be especially cautious with injuries around the anus, as penetrating rectal injuries can be easily missed.\n\n* Look for signs of bruising and penetrating trauma, listen for bowel sounds, check renal angles and examine urine for blood. Ultrasound is useful, if available, to investigate intra-abdominal bleeding and injury to internal organs.\n\n▶ Assess the patient for airway patency and breathing, give oxygen, assess the circulation, set up an IV access, take blood for Hb, blood cross-matching and amylase activity (if available).\n\n▶ Transfuse as necessary.\n\n▶ Seek urgent surgical advice.\n\n## 9.3.5 Fractures\nChildren heal fractures well if the bones are aligned properly.\n\n### Diagnosis\n* Pain, swelling, deformity, crepitus, unnatural movement and loss of function\n* Fractures may be closed (the skin is intact) or open (there is wounding of the skin).

The goal of caring for any wound is to stop bleeding, prevent infection, assess damage to underlying structures and promote healing. More detailed surgical guidance is given in the WHO manual *Surgical care in the district hospital*.\n\n* **Stop bleeding**\n  - Direct pressure will control any bleeding (see figure on p. 280).\n  - Bleeding from extremities can be controlled for periods of not more than 10 min with a sphygmomanometer cuff inflated above the arterial pressure.\n  - Prolonged use (> 10 min) of tourniquets can damage the extremity. Never use a tourniquet in a child with sickle-cell anaemia.\n\n* **Prevent infection**\n  - Cleaning the wound is the most important way of preventing wound infection. Most wounds are contaminated when first seen. They may contain blood clots, dirt, dead or dying tissue and perhaps foreign bodies.\n  - Clean the skin around the wound thoroughly with soap and water or antiseptic. Pour water and antiseptic into the wound.\n  - After giving a local anaesthetic such as lidocaine (≤ 3 mg/kg) or 0.25% bupivacaine (≤ 1 ml/kg) by infiltration around the wound, search carefully for foreign bodies, and excise any dead tissue. Determine what damage may have been done. Major wounds require a general anaesthetic.\n\n279", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 303, "section": "PRINCIPLES OF WOUND CARE\n\nTreatment of a supra-condylar fracture is shown on the previous page.

Initially, the prolapsed section reduces spontaneously, but later it may require manual reduction.\n* May be complicated by bleeding or even strangulation, with gangrene\n\n#### Treatment\n* If the prolapsed rectum is not dead (it is pink or red and bleeds), reduce with gentle constant pressure.\n* Apply firm strapping across the buttocks to maintain the reduction.\n* Correct the underlying cause of diarrhoea and malnutrition.\n* Treat for a helminth infection (such as mebendazole at 100 mg orally twice a day for 3 days or 500 mg once only).\n* Review by a surgeon experienced in paediatric surgery is required. Recurrent prolapse may require a Thiersch stitch.\n\n## 9.5 Infections requiring surgery\n\n### 9.5.1 Abscess\n\nInfection can cause a collection of pus in almost any area of the body.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n* Fever, swelling, tenderness and a fluctuant mass.\n* Determine the cause of the abscess (e.g. injection, foreign body or underlying bone infection). Injection abscesses usually develop 2–3 weeks after an injection.\n\n#### Treatment\n* Incision and drainage (see figure on p. 288).\n* Incision and drainage of large abscesses may require general anaesthesia.\n* Antibiotics: cloxacillin (25–50 mg/kg four times a day) for 5 days or until surrounding cellulitis resolves.

Observe the mother while breastfeeding to decide whether she needs help. Observe:\n\n• how the infant is attached to the breast (see next page). Signs of good attachment are:\n  – areola visible above infant's mouth\n  – mouth wide open\n  – lower lip turned out\n  – infant's chin touching the breast\n• how the mother holds her infant (see next page)\n  – should be held close to the mother\n  – should face the breast\n  – body should be in a straight line with the head\n  – whole body should be supported\n• how the mother holds her breast\n\n**Overcoming difficulties**\n\n1. *'Not enough milk'*\n\nAlmost all mothers can produce enough breast milk for one or even two infants; however, sometimes an infant is not getting enough breast milk.

If necessary, express the breast milk and give it by cup. If this cannot be done, artificial feeds may be needed until an adequate milk supply is established.\n\n## 2. How to increase the milk supply\n\nThe main way to increase or restart the supply of breast milk is for the infant to suckle often in order to stimulate the breast.\n• Give other feeds from a cup while waiting for breast milk to come. Do not use bottles or pacifiers. Reduce the other milk by 30–60 ml per day as the mother's breast milk starts to increase.

Refusal or reluctance to breastfeed\n\nThe main reasons why an infant might refuse to breastfeed are:\n\n* The infant is ill, in pain or sedated.\n  - If the infant is able to suckle, encourage the mother to breastfeed more often. If the infant is very ill, the mother may need to express breast milk and feed by cup or gastric tube until the infant can breastfeed again.\n  - If the infant is in hospital, arrange for the mother to stay with the infant in order to breastfeed.\n  - Help the mother to find a way to hold her infant without pressing on a painful place.\n  - Explain to the mother how to clear a blocked nose. Suggest short feeds, more often than usual, for a few days.\n  - A sore mouth may be due to *Candida* infection (thrush) or teething. Treat the infection with nystatin (100 000 U/ml) suspension. Give 1–2 ml dropped into the mouth four times a day for 7 days. If this is not available, apply 1% gentian violet solution. Encourage the mother of a teething infant to be patient and keep offering the breast.\n  - If the mother is on regular sedation, reduce the dose or try a less sedating alternative.\n\n* There is difficulty with the breastfeeding technique\n  - Help the mother with her technique: ensure that the infant is positioned and attached well without pressing on the infant's head or shaking the breast.\n  - Advise her not to use a feeding bottle or pacifier: if necessary, use a cup.\n  - Treat engorgement by removing milk from the breast; otherwise mastitis or an abscess may develop. If the infant is not able to suckle, help the mother to express her milk.\n  - Help reduce oversupply. If an infant is poorly attached and suckles ineffectively, the infant may breastfeed more frequently or for a longer time, stimulating the breast so that more milk is produced than required. Oversupply may also occur if a mother tries to make her infant feed from both breasts at each feed, when this is not necessary.\n\n* A change has upset the infant.\n  Changes such as separation from the mother, a new carer, illness of the mother, a change in the family routine or the mother's smell (due to a different soap, food or menstruation) can upset the infant and cause refusal to breastfeed.\n\n> **10.

SUPPORTIVE CARE\n\n## SUPPORTING BREASTFEEDING\n\n### Low-birth-weight and sick infants\n\nInfants with a birth weight < 2.5 kg need breast milk even more than larger infants; often, however, they cannot breastfeed immediately after birth, especially if they are very small.\n\nFor the first few days, an infant may not be able to take oral feeds and may have to be fed IV. Initiate early feeding with small oral feeds even on day 1 or as soon as the infant can tolerate enteral feeds.\n\nVery low-birth-weight infants (< 1.5 kg) may have to be fed by naso- or orogastric tube during the first days of life. Preferably give the mother's expressed breast milk. The mother can let the infant suck on her cleaned finger while being tube fed. This may stimulate the infant's digestive tract and help weight gain.\n\nLow-birth-weight infants at ≥ 32 weeks' gestational age can start suckling on the breast. Let the mother put her infant to the breast as soon as the infant is well enough. Continue giving expressed breast milk by cup or tube to make sure that the infant gets all the nutrition needed.\n\nInfants at ≥ 34–36 weeks' gestational age can usually take all that they need directly from the breast.\n\n### Infants who cannot breastfeed\n\nNon-breastfed infants should receive either:\n\n* expressed breast milk (preferably from their own mothers) or donor human milk where safe and affordable milk-banking facilities are available\n\n* formula milk prepared with clean water according to instructions or, if possible, ready-made liquid formula\n\n* If the above are not available, consider animal milk.

Feed by naso- or orogastric tube if the child is lethargic or severely anorexic or unable to swallow.\n\n## 10.1.2 Nutritional management of sick children\n\nThe principles for feeding sick infants and young children are:\n• Continue breastfeeding.\n• Do not withhold food.\n• Give frequent, small feeds, every 2–3 h.\n• Coax, encourage, and be patient.\n• Feed by nasogastric tube if the child is severely anorexic.\n• Promote catch-up growth after the appetite returns.\n\nThe food provided should be:\n• palatable (to the child)\n• easily eaten (soft or liquid consistency)\n• easily digested\n• nutritious: rich in energy and nutrients.\n\nThe basic principle of nutritional management is to provide a diet with sufficient energy-producing foods and high-quality proteins. Foods with a high oil or fat content are recommended; up to 30–40% of the total calories can be given as fat. In addition, feeding at frequent intervals is necessary to achieve high energy intake. For sick children, provide multivitamin and mineral supplements.\n\nThe child should be encouraged to eat relatively small amounts frequently. If young children are left to feed themselves or have to compete with siblings for food, they may not get enough to eat.\n\nA blocked nose, with dry or thick mucus, may interfere with feeding.

The frequency of monitoring depends on the severity and nature of the illness (see relevant sections in chapters 3–8).\n\nDetails of the child's condition and progress should be recorded, so that they can be reviewed by other members of staff. A senior health worker who is responsible for the care of the child and has the authority to change treatment should supervise the records and examine the child regularly.\n\nChildren who are seriously ill should be visited by a doctor (or other senior health professional) soon after admission to hospital. These visits should be seen as an opportunity to encourage communication between the families of sick children and hospital staff.\n\n319", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 343, "section": "CHAPTER 11"}}
{"content": "11. MONITORING\n\n# 11. MONITORING\n\n## MONITORING CHART\n\n### 11.2 Monitoring chart\n\nA monitoring chart should include the following items.\n\n* patient's details\n* vital signs (indicated by pulse rate and volume, respiratory rate and presence of lower chest indrawing, coma score or level of consciousness [AVPU], temperature and body weight)\n* fluid balance (urine output, any vomiting, any stool)\n* presence of clinical signs, complications and positive findings of investigations. At each review of the child, record whether these signs are still present. Record any new signs or complications.\n* treatments given\n* feeding and nutrition. Record the child's weight on admission and at appropriate intervals during treatment. There should be a daily record of the child's drinking, breastfeeding and eating. Record the amount of food taken and details of any feeding problems.\n\nSee Annex 6 (p. 403) for references to examples of monitoring charts and critical care pathways.\n\n### 11.3 Audit of paediatric care\n\nThe quality of care given to sick children in hospital can be improved if there is a system for reviewing the outcomes of each child admitted to the hospital. At a minimum, the system should keep records of all children who died in the hospital. Trends in case fatality rates over time can then be compared, and the treatment given can be discussed by all staff with the aim of identifying any problems and finding solutions. Clinical audit meetings to discuss near-death events or deaths in children, especially those in which some aspect of treatment might have gone wrong, can also be helpful. The aim is to improve care and solve problems, not to attribute blame for errors.\n\nAn audit of hospital paediatric care can be carried out by comparing the quality of care actually given with a recognized standard, such as the WHO recommendations contained in this *Pocket book*. A successful audit calls for full, constructive participation of all medical and nursing staff. The audit should be simple and not take up too much of the time required for caring for sick children. One suggestion is to ask medical and nursing staff for their views on improving the quality of care and to give priority to the conditions or problems they identify.\n\n320", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 344, "section": "11.

In younger or severely malnourished children, use the outer side of the thigh midway between the hip and the knee or over the deltoid muscle in the upper arm. Push the needle (23–25-gauge) into the muscle at a 90° angle (45° angle in the thigh). Draw back the plunger to make sure there is no blood (if there is, withdraw slightly and try again). Give the drug by pushing the plunger slowly until the end. Remove the needle, and press a small swab or cotton-wool firmly over the injection site.\n\n*Intramuscular injection into the thigh*\n\n### A1.1.2 Subcutaneous\nSelect the site as described above for intramuscular injection. Push the needle (23–25-gauge) under the skin at a 45° angle into the subcutaneous fatty tissue. Do not enter the underlying muscle. Draw back the plunger to make sure there is no blood (if there is, withdraw slightly and try again). Give the drug by pushing the plunger slowly until the end. Remove the needle and press cotton-wool firmly over the injection site.\n\n### A1.1.3 Intradermal\nFor an intradermal injection, select an undamaged, uninfected area of skin (e.g. over the deltoid in the upper arm). Stretch the skin between the thumb and forefinger of one hand; with the other, slowly insert the needle (25 gauge), bevel upwards, about 2 mm just under and almost parallel to the surface of the skin. Considerable resistance is felt when injecting intradermally. A raised, blanched bleb showing the surface of the hair follicles is a sign that the injection has been given correctly.\n\n336", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 360, "section": "PRACTICAL PROCEDURES"}}

{"content": "PRACTICAL PROCEDURES\n\nPRACTICAL PROCEDURES\n\n# INTRAOSSEOUS INFUSION\n\n## Care of the cannula\nSecure the cannula when introduced. This may require splinting neighbouring joints to limit the movement of the catheter. Keep the overlying skin clean and dry. Flush and fill the cannula with normal saline immediately after the initial insertion and after each injection.\n\n## Common complications\nSuperficial infection of the skin at the cannula site is the commonest complication. The infection may lead to thrombophlebitis, which will occlude the vein and result in fever. The surrounding skin is red and tender. Remove the cannula to reduce the risk of further spread of the infection. Apply a warm, moist compress to the site for 30 min every 6 h. If fever persists for more than 24 h, antibiotic treatment (effective against *Staphylococcus aureus*) should be given.\n\n## Intravenous drug administration through an indwelling cannula\nAttach the syringe containing the IV drug to the injection port of the cannula and introduce the drug. Once all the drug has been given, flush with normal saline until all the blood has been expelled and the catheter is filled with the solution.\n\nIf infusion through a peripheral vein or scalp vein is not possible, and it is essential to give IV fluids to keep the child alive:\n* set up an intraosseous infusion\n* or use a central vein\n* or perform a venous cut-down.\n\n## A1.2.2 Intraosseous infusion\nIntraosseous infusion is a safe, simple, reliable method of giving fluid and drugs in an emergency when venous access is not possible.\n\nThe first choice for the puncture is the proximal tibia. The site for needle insertion is in the middle of the antero-medial surface of the tibia, at the junction of the upper and middle third to avoid damaging the epiphyseal plate (which is higher in the tibia) or at least 1–2 cm below the tibial tuberosity. An alternative site for needle insertion is the distal femur, 2 cm above the lateral condyle.\n\n* Prepare the necessary equipment, i.e.:\n  - bone marrow aspiration or intraosseous needles (15–18 gauge or, if not available, 21 gauge). If these are not available, bone marrow needles or large-bore hypodermic or butterfly needles can be used in young children\n  - antiseptic solution and sterile gauze to clean the site\n\n340", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 364, "section": "PRACTICAL PROCEDURES"}}

Hold the child firmly in this position. Make sure that the airway is not obstructed and the child can breathe normally. Take particular care in holding young infants. The assistant should not hold a young infant by the neck nor flex the neck to avoid airway obstruction.\n\n### Check anatomical landmarks\n\nLocate the space between the third and fourth or between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.

In young infants this decrease in resistance is not always felt, so advance the needle very carefully.\n• Withdraw the stylet, and drops of CSF will pass out of the needle. If no CSF is obtained, the stylet can be reinserted and the needle advanced slightly.\n• Obtain a sample of 0.5–1 ml CSF, and place in a sterile container.\n• Withdraw the needle and stylet completely, and put pressure over the site for a few seconds. Put a sterile dressing over the needle puncture site.\n• If the needle is introduced too far, a lumbar vein may be punctured.

Withdraw a sample for microscopy and other tests, and place in a container.\n\nIf the fluid is clear (straw-coloured or brownish), pull out the needle or catheter after withdrawing enough fluid to relieve distress, and put a dressing over the puncture site. Consider a differential diagnosis of TB (see section 4.7.2, p. 115).\n\nIf the fluid is thin pus or cloudy (like milk), leave the catheter in place so that you can draw out more pus several times a day. Make sure you seal the end of the catheter so that no air can get in.\n\nIf the fluid is thick pus, which cannot pass easily through the needle or catheter, insert a chest tube (see figure).\n\n## Insertion of a chest tube\n\nSelect and prepare the site as described above.\n\n* Make a 2–3-cm skin incision along the line of the Intercostal space, just above the rib below (to avoid damaging the vessels which lie under the lower edge of each rib).\n* Use sterile forceps to push through the subcutaneous tissue just above the upper edge of the rib, and puncture the pleura.\n* Pass a gloved finger into the incision and clear a path to the pleura.

{"content": "ANNEX 2\n\n# ANNEX 2\n\n## Drug dosages and regimens\n\nThis section gives the doses of the drugs mentioned in these guidelines that are suitable for infants and children. For ease of use and to avoid having to make calculations, doses are given according to the body weight of the child. As errors in calculating drug doses are common in hospital practice worldwide, calculations should be avoided, when possible. Doses are given covering a range of body weights, from 3–29 kg. A table for neonates in the first 2 months of life is included in Chapter 3, pp. 69–72.\n\nFor some drugs (for example, antiretroviral drugs), however, it is better to calculate the **exact** individual doses on the basis of the body weight of the child, where this is possible. The drugs include those for which the exact dose is critically important to ensure a therapeutic effect or to avoid toxicity, e.g. digoxin, chloramphenicol, aminophylline and antiretroviral drugs.\n\nFor some antiretroviral drugs, the recommended dosages are often given according to the surface area of the child. A table giving approximate child surface area for different weight categories is given below to help in this calculation. The doses in the table can then be used to check that the calculated dose is approximately correct (and to check that a calculation error has not been made).\n\n$$\\text{Body surface area in m}^2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{height (cm)} \\times \\text{weight (kg)}}{3600}}$$\n\nThus, a child weighing 10 kg and 72 cm long has a body surface area of\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{10 \\times 72}{3600}} = 0.45 \\text{ m}^2$$\n\n353", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 377, "section": "ANNEX 2"}}

Solutions containing low sodium, such as 0.18% sodium chloride with 4% glucose, or 5% glucose in water, should not be used for rehydration or fluid maintenance. Appropriate sodium-containing IV maintenance fluids should contain glucose to avoid hypoglycaemia and starvation ketosis in children who are unable to feed orally or by nasogastric tube.\n\n* **Resuscitation:** Children who are severely dehydrated or with signs of shock should be resuscitated with isotonic IV solutions (normal saline 0.9% or Ringer's lactate).\n\n* **Intravenous maintenance fluid:** Children who require IV fluids for maintenance should be managed with Ringer's lactate solution with 5% dextrose or 0.9% normal saline with 5% glucose or half-normal saline (0.45% sodium chloride) with 5% glucose.\n\n## Notes", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 402, "section": "378"}}

His weight-for-age is –3 SD.\n\nExample 2: Girl aged 27 months weighing 6.5 kg. Her weight-for-age is < –3 SD.\n\nThe lines in the charts on pp. 384–5 correspond to –2 (low weight-for-age) and –3 SD (very low weight-for-age). Please note that you should use tables in section A5.2, pp. 386–402 for weight-for-height to determine whether a child has severe acute malnutrition.\n\n**Table A5.1.1 Weight-for-age from birth to 5 years: Boys**\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Months</th>\n<th>–3 SD</th>\n<th>–2 SD</th>\n<th>–1 SD</th>\n<th>Median</th>\n<th>1 SD</th>\n<th>2 SD</th>\n<th>3 SD</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2.1</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n<td>2.9</td>\n<td>3.3</td>\n<td>3.9</td>\n<td>4.4</td>\n<td>5.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2.9</td>\n<td>3.4</td>\n<td>3.9</td>\n<td>4.5</td>\n<td>5.1</td>\n<td>5.8</td>\n<td>6.6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n379\n\nWEIGHT / AGE\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Months</th>\n        <th>–3 SD</th>\n        <th>–2 SD</th>\n        <th>–1 SD</th>\n        <th>Median</th>\n        <th>1 SD</th>\n        <th>2 SD</th>\n        <th>3 SD</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tr>\n        <td>0</td>\n        <td>2.1</td>\n        <td>2.5</td>\n        <td>2.9</td>\n        <td>3.3</td>\n        <td>3.9</td>\n        <td>4.4</td>\n        <td>5.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>2.9</td>\n        <td>3.4</td>\n        <td>3.9</td>\n        <td>4.5</td>\n        <td>5.1</td>\n        <td>5.8</td>\n        <td>6.6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>2</td>\n        <td>3.8</td>\n        <td>4.3</td>\n        <td>4.9</td>\n        <td>5.6</td>\n        <td>6.3</td>\n        <td>7.1</td>\n        <td>8.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>3</td>\n        <td>4.4</td>\n        <td>5.0</td>\n        <td>5.7</td>\n        <td>6.4</td>\n        <td>7.2</td>\n        <td>8.0</td>\n        <td>9.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>4</td>\n        <td>4.9</td>\n        <td>5.6</td>\n        <td>6.2</td>\n        <td>7.0</td>\n        <td>7.8</td>\n        <td>8.7</td>\n        <td>9.7</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>5</td>\n        <td>5.3</td>\n        <td>6.0</td>\n        <td>6.7</td>\n        <td>7.5</td>\n        <td>8.4</td>\n        <td>9.3</td>\n        <td>10.4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>6</td>\n        <td>5.7</td>\n        <td>6.4</td>\n        <td>7.1</td>\n        <td>7.9</td>\n        <td>8.8</td>\n        <td>9.8</td>\n        <td>10.9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>7</td>\n        <td>5.9</td>\n        <td>6.7</td>\n        <td>7.4</td>\n        <td>8.3</td>\n        <td>9.2</td>\n        <td>10.3</td>\n        <td>11.4</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>8</td>\n        <td>6.2</td>\n        <td>6.9</td>\n        <td>7.7</td>\n        <td>8.6</td>\n        <td>9.6</td>\n        <td>10.7</td>\n        <td>11.9</td>\n    </tr></table>", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 403, "section": "ANNEX 5"}}

{"content": "WEIGHT-FOR-LENGTH FROM BIRTH TO 2 YEARS: BOYS\n\nWEIGHT-FOR-LENGTH FROM BIRTH TO 2 YEARS: BOYS\n\n## A5.2 Calculating a child's weight-for-length or -height\n\nTables A5.2.1 and A5.2.2 on pp. 386, 391 give the WHO normalized reference weight-for-length (45–110 cm) and A5.2.3 and A5.2.4 on pp. 395–9 weight-for-height (65–120 cm), by sex.\n\nThe interpretation of a fixed percentage of the median value varies by age and height, and generally the two scales cannot be compared. The approximate percentage of the median values for –1 and –2 SD are 90% and 80% of the median, respectively.<sup>1</sup>\n\n'Length' in most cases is measured for a child < 85 cm, and 'height' for a child ≥ 85 cm. Recumbent length is on average 0.5 cm greater than standing height, although the difference is of no importance for the individual child. A correction may be made by deducting 0.5 cm from all lengths > 84.9 cm if standing height cannot be measured.\n\nIn the tables:\n* Locate the appropriate table for boys or girls.\n* Locate the row containing the child's length in the left column.\n* Note where the child's weight lies with respect to the lengths recorded in this row.\n* Look up the column to read the weight-for-length of the child.\n\nExample 1: Boy: length 61 cm, weight 5.3 kg. His weight-for-length is –2 SD.\nExample 2: Girl: length 67 cm, weight 4.3 kg.

This second edition is based on evidence from several WHO updated and published clinical guidelines. It is for use in both inpatient and outpatient care in small hospitals with basic laboratory facilities and essential medicines. In some settings, these guidelines can be used in any facilities where sick children are admitted for inpatient care.\n\nThe Pocket Book is one of a series of documents and tools that support the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). The guidelines require the hospital to have (1) the capacity to carry out certain essential investigations, such as pulse oximetry, blood glucose, blood smear examinations for malaria parasites, estimation of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and full blood count, blood group and cross-match, and basic microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid and urine; and where possible blood and urine culture, ultrasound and basic x-rays; (2) essential medicines for the care of seriously ill children. Advanced and high care treatment options, such as intensive care or mechanical ventilation, are not described.\n\nThese guidelines focus on the management of the major causes of childhood mortality in most developing countries, such as newborn problems, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, septicaemia, measles and related conditions, severe acute malnutrition and paediatric HIV/AIDS. It also covers some common surgical conditions that can be managed in small hospitals.\n\nDetails of the evidence on which the Pocket Book is based can be found on WHO website from the published guidelines provided in the bibliography. These guidelines are applicable in most areas of the world and may be adapted to suit country specific circumstances. The online version will be updated regularly as new evidence emerges.\n\n**For further information please contact:**\n\nMaternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (MCA)  \nWorld Health Organization  \n20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland  \nTel +41-22 791 3281 • E-mail mncah@who.int  \nWebsite www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/en\n\n**ISBN 978 92 4 154837 3**", "metadata": {"source": "POCKET BOOK OF Hospital care", "page": 438, "section": "EMERGENCY DRUGS"}}
