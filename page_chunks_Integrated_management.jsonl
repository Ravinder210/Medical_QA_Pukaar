No child under 5 years should be given an inhaler without a spacer. A spacer works as well as a nebuliser if correctly used.  \n* From salbutamol metered dose inhaler (100 µg/puff) give 2 puffs.  \n* Repeat up to 3 times every 15 minutes before classifying pneumonia.\n\n### Spacers can be made in the following way:  \n* Use a 500ml drink bottle or similar.  \n* Cut a hole in the bottle base in the same shape as the mouthpiece of the inhaler. This can be done using a sharp knife.  \n* Cut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.  \n* Cut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.  \n* Flame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.  \n* In a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.  \n* Alternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\n\n### To use an inhaler with a spacer:  \n* Remove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.  \n* Insert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.  \n* The child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.  \n* A carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.  \n* Wait for three to four breaths and repeat.  \n* For younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n\n> *If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.*\n\n----\n\n## Give Oral Antimalarial for MALARIA\n\n* **If Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL)**  \n  * Give the first dose of artemether-lumefantrine in the clinic and observe for one hour.

She should:\n  - touch her infant's lips with her nipple\n  - wait until her infant's mouth is opening wide\n  - move her infant quickly onto her breast, aiming the infant's lower lip well below the nipple.\n\n* Look for signs of good attachment and effective suckling. If the attachment or suckling is not good, try again.\n\n## TEACH THE MOTHER HOW TO EXPRESS BREAST MILK\n\nAsk the mother to:  \n* Wash her hands thoroughly.  \n* Make herself comfortable.  \n* Hold a wide necked container under her nipple and areola.  \n* Place her thumb on top of the breast and the first finger on the under side of the breast so they are opposite each other (at least 4 cm from the tip of the nipple).  \n* Compress and release the breast tissue between her finger and thumb a few times.  \n* If the milk does not appear she should re-position her thumb and finger closer to the nipple and compress and release the breast as before.  \n* Compress and release all the way around the breast, keeping her fingers the same distance from the nipple. Be careful not to squeeze the nipple or to rub the skin or move her thumb or finger on the skin.  \n* Express one breast until the milk just drips, then express the other breast until the milk just drips.  \n* Alternate between breasts 5 or 6 times, for at least 20 to 30 minutes.  \n* Stop expressing when the milk no longer flows but drips from the start.\n\n## TEACH THE MOTHER HOW TO FEED BY A CUP\n\n* Put a cloth on the infant's front to protect his clothes as some milk can spill.  \n* Hold the infant semi-upright on the lap.  \n* Put a measured amount of milk in the cup.  \n* Hold the cup so that it rests lightly on the infant's lower lip.  \n* Tip the cup so that the milk just reaches the infant's lips.  \n* Allow the infant to take the milk himself. DO NOT pour the milk into the infant's mouth.\n\n## TEACH THE MOTHER HOW TO KEEP THE LOW WEIGHT INFANT WARM AT HOME\n\n* Keep the young infant in the same bed with the mother.  \n* Keep the room warm (at least 25°C) with home heating device and make sure that there is no draught of cold air.  \n* Avoid bathing the low weight infant. When washing or bathing, do it in a very warm room with warm water, dry immediately and thoroughly after bathing and clothe the young infant immediately.  \n* Change clothes (e.g. nappies) whenever they are wet.  \n* Provide skin to skin contact as much as possible, day and night. For skin to skin contact:  \n  - Dress the infant in a warm shirt open at the front, a nappy, hat and socks.  \n  - Place the infant in skin to skin contact on the mother's chest between her breasts. Keep the infant's head turned to one side.  \n  - Cover the infant with mother's clothes (and an additional warm blanket in cold weather).  \n* When not in skin to skin contact, keep the young infant clothed or covered as much as possible at all times. Dress the young infant with extra clothing including hat and socks, loosely wrap the young infant in a soft dry cloth and cover with a blanket.  \n* Check frequently if the hands and feet are warm.

{"content": "PRINCIPLES OF THE INTEGRATED CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT\n\n# PRINCIPLES OF THE INTEGRATED CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT\n\nIMCI clinical guidelines are based on the following principles:\n\n1. **Examining all sick children aged up to five years** of age for **general danger signs** and all young infants for signs of **very severe disease**. These signs indicate severe illness and the need for immediate referral or admission to hospital.\n\n2. The children and infants are then **assessed for main symptoms**:  \n   * In older children the main symptoms include:  \n     - Cough or difficulty breathing,  \n     - Diarrhoea,  \n     - Fever, and  \n     - Ear infection.  \n   * In young infants, the main symptoms include:  \n     - Local bacterial infection,  \n     - Diarrhoea, and  \n     - Jaundice.\n\n3. Then in addition, all sick children are **routinely checked** for:  \n   * Nutritional and immunization status,  \n   * HIV status in high HIV settings, and  \n   * Other potential problems.\n\n4. Only a **limited number of clinical signs** are used, selected on the basis of their sensitivity and specificity to detect disease through classification.\n\nA combination of individual signs leads to a **child's classification** within one or more symptom groups rather than a diagnosis. The classification of illness is based on a colour-coded triage system:  \n- ♦ **\"PINK\"** indicates urgent hospital referral or admission,  \n- ♦ **\"YELLOW\"** indicates initiation of specific outpatient treatment,  \n- ♦ **\"GREEN\"** indicates supportive home care.\n\n5. IMCI management procedures use **a limited number of essential drugs** and encourage active participation of caregivers in the treatment of their children.\n\n6. An essential component of IMCI is the **counselling of caregivers** regarding home care:  \n   * Appropriate feeding and fluids,  \n   * When to return to the clinic immediately, and  \n   * When to return for follow-up.", "metadata": {"source": "Integrated Management of Childhood Illness", "page": 79, "section": "PRINCIPLES OF THE INTEGRATED CLINICAL CASE MANAGEMENT"}}
{"content": "IMCI Chart Booklet\n\n# IMCI Chart Booklet\n\nThis IMCI chart booklet is for use by nurses, clinicians and other health professionals who see young infants and children less than five years old. It facilitates the use of the IMCI case management process and the charts describe the sequence of all the case management steps. The chart booklet should be used by all health professionals providing care to sick children to help them apply the IMCI case management guidelines. Health professionals should always use the chart booklet for easy reference during the process of clinical care.\n\nThe chart booklet is divided into two main parts because clinical signs in sick young infants and older children are somewhat different and the case management procedures also differ between these age groups:\n\n* **SICK CHILD AGED 2 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS.** This part contains all the necessary clinical algorithms, information and instructions on how to provide care to sick children aged 2 months to 5 years.\n\nand\n\n* **SICK YOUNG INFANT AGED UP TO 2 MONTHS.** This part includes case management clinical algorithms for the care of a young infant aged up to 2 months.\n\nEach of these parts contains IMCI charts corresponding to the main steps of the IMCI case management process.\n\nFor further information contact:  \nMaternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (MCA)  \nWorld Health Organization  \n20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland  \nTel +41-22 791 3281 • E-mail mncah@who.int  \nWebsite www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/en  \n\nISBN 978 92 4 150682 3  \nBarcode: 9 789241 506823", "metadata": {"source": "Integrated Management of Childhood Illness", "page": 80, "section": "IMCI Chart Booklet"}}
