The amount of ﬂuid given should be guided by the child’s\n      response. Avoid over-hydration.

TRIAGE\n\n\nSPECIFIC POISONS\n\nPetroleum compounds\nExamples: kerosene, turpentine substitutes, petrol\n  Do not induce vomiting or give activated charcoal, as inhalation can cause\n  respiratory distress with hypoxaemia due to pulmonary oedema and lipoid\n  pneumonia. Ingestion can cause encephalopathy.\n  Speciﬁc treatment includes oxygen therapy if there is respiratory distress\n  (see p. 312).\n\nOrganophosphorus and carbamate compounds\nExamples: organophosphorus compounds (malathion, parathion, tetra ethyl\npyrophosphate, mevinphos (Phosdrin)); carbamates (methiocarb, carbaryl)\nThese compounds can be absorbed through the skin, ingested or inhaled.\nThe child may complain of vomiting, diarrhoea, blurred vision or weakness.\nThe signs are those of excess parasympathetic activation: excessive bronchial\nsecretion, salivation, sweating, lachrymation, slow pulse, small pupils, convul-\nsions, muscle weakness or twitching, then paralysis and loss of bladder control,\npulmonary oedema and respiratory depression.\n\nTreatment\n  Remove the poison by irrigating eye if in eye or washing skin if on skin.\n  Give activated charcoal within 4 h of ingestion if ingested.\n  Do not induce vomiting because most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents.\n  In a serious case of ingestion, when activated charcoal cannot be given,\n  consider careful aspiration of stomach contents by nasogastric tube (the\n  airway should be protected).\n  If the child has signs of excess parasympathetic activation (see above), one\n  of the main risks is excessive bronchial secretion. Give atropine at 20 µg/\n  kg (maximum dose, 2000 µg or 2 mg) IM or IV every 5–10 min, depending\n  on the severity of the poisoning, until there is no sign of secretions in the\n  chest, the skin becomes ﬂushed and dry, the pupils dilate and tachycardia\n  develops. Doses may be repeated every 1–4 h for at least 24 h to maintain\n  atropine effects. The main aim is to reduce bronchial secretions while avoid-\n  ing atropine toxicity. Auscultate the chest for signs of respiratory secretions,\n  and monitor respiratory rate, heart rate and coma score (if appropriate).\n  Check for hypoxaemia by pulse oximetry if atropine is given, as it can cause\n  heart irregularities (ventricular arrhythmia) in hypoxic children. Give oxygen\n  if the oxygen saturation is ≤ 90%\n\n30",

TRIAGE\n\n# SNAKE BITE\n\n* If itching or an urticarial rash, restlessness, fever, cough or difficult breathing develop, then stop antivenom and give adrenaline at 0.15 ml of 1:1000 IM (see anaphylaxis treatment, p. 109. Possible additional treatment includes bronchodilators, antihistamines (chlorphenamine at 0.25 mg/kg) and steroids. When the child is stable, re-start antivenom infusion slowly.\n\n* More antivenom should be given after 6 h if there is recurrence of blood clotting disorder or after 1–2 h if the patient is continuing to bleed briskly or has deteriorating neurotoxic or cardiovascular signs.\n\n* Blood transfusion should not be required if antivenom is given. Clotting function returns to normal only after clotting factors are produced by the liver. The response of abnormal neurological signs to antivenom is more variable and depends on the type of venom.\n\n* If there is no response to antivenom infusion, it should be repeated.\n\n* Anticholinesterases can reverse neurological signs in children bitten by some species of snake (see standard textbooks of paediatrics for further details).\n\n## Other treatment\n\n* Surgical opinion: Seek a surgical opinion if there is severe swelling in a limb, it is pulseless or painful or there is local necrosis. Surgical care will include:\n  - excision of dead tissue from wound\n  - incision of fascial membranes (fasciotomy) to relieve pressure in limb compartments, if necessary\n  - skin grafting, if there is extensive necrosis\n  - tracheostomy (or endotracheal intubation) if the muscles involved in swallowing are paralysed\n\n## Supportive care\n\n* Give fluids orally or by nasogastric tube according to daily requirements (see p. 304). Keep a close record of fluid intake and output.\n\n* Provide adequate pain relief.\n\n* Elevate the limb if swollen.\n\n* Give antitetanus prophylaxis.\n\n* Antibiotic treatment is not required unless there is tissue necrosis at the wound site.\n\n* Avoid IM injections.\n\n36\n",

YOUNG INFANTS\n\n\nESSENTIAL NEWBORN CARE AT DELIVERY\n\nThis chapter provides guidance on essential newborn care and the management\nof problems in neonates and young infants, from birth to 2 months of age. It\nincludes neonatal resuscitation, the recognition and management of neonatal\nsepsis and other bacterial infections, and the management of preterm and\nlow-birth-weight infants. A table giving the doses of commonly used drugs for\nneonates and young infants is included at the end of this chapter, which also\nlists the dosages for low-birth-weight and premature infants.\n\n3.1   Essential newborn care at delivery\nMost newborns require only simple supportive care at and after delivery.\n      Dry the infant with a clean towel.\n      Observe the infant while drying (see Chart 12).\n      Maintain the infant in skin-to-skin contact position with the mother.\n      Cover the infant to prevent heat loss.\n      Clamp and cut the cord at least 1 min after birth.\n      Encourage the mother to initiate breastfeeding within the ﬁrst hour.\nSkin-to-skin contact and early breastfeeding are the best ways to keep an infant\nwarm and prevent hypoglycaemia. Term and low-birth-weight neonates weigh-\ning > 1200 g who do not have complications and are clinically stable should\nbe put in skin-to-skin contact with the mother soon after birth after they have\nbeen dried thoroughly to prevent hypothermia.\n\n3.2 Neonatal\n      resuscitation\nResuscitation may be required for some infants, such as those born to mothers\nwith chronic illness, to mothers who had a previous fetal or neonatal death,\nto mothers with pre-eclampsia, in multiple pregnancies, in preterm delivery,\nin abnormal presentation of the fetus, infants with a prolapsed cord, or after\nprolonged labour, rupture of membranes or meconium-stained liquor.\nFor many infants, resuscitation cannot be anticipated before delivery.
