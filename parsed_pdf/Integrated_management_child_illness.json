This can be done using a sharp knife.  \n* Cut the bottle between the upper quarter and the lower 3/4 and disregard the upper quarter of the bottle.  \n* Cut a small V in the border of the large open part of the bottle to fit to the child's nose and be used as a mask.  \n* Flame the edge of the cut bottle with a candle or a lighter to soften it.  \n* In a small baby, a mask can be made by making a similar hole in a plastic (not polystyrene) cup.  \n* Alternatively commercial spacers can be used if available.\n\n### To use an inhaler with a spacer:  \n* Remove the inhaler cap. Shake the inhaler well.  \n* Insert mouthpiece of the inhaler through the hole in the bottle or plastic cup.  \n* The child should put the opening of the bottle into his mouth and breath in and out through the mouth.  \n* A carer then presses down the inhaler and sprays into the bottle while the child continues to breath normally.  \n* Wait for three to four breaths and repeat.  \n* For younger children place the cup over the child's mouth and use as a spacer in the same way.\n\n> *If a spacer is being used for the first time, it should be primed by 4-5 extra puffs from the inhaler.*\n\n----\n\n## Give Oral Antimalarial for MALARIA\n\n* **If Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL)**  \n  * Give the first dose of artemether-lumefantrine in the clinic and observe for one hour.

These signs indicate severe illness and the need for immediate referral or admission to hospital.\n\n2. The children and infants are then **assessed for main symptoms**:  \n   * In older children the main symptoms include:  \n     - Cough or difficulty breathing,  \n     - Diarrhoea,  \n     - Fever, and  \n     - Ear infection.  \n   * In young infants, the main symptoms include:  \n     - Local bacterial infection,  \n     - Diarrhoea, and  \n     - Jaundice.\n\n3. Then in addition, all sick children are **routinely checked** for:  \n   * Nutritional and immunization status,  \n   * HIV status in high HIV settings, and  \n   * Other potential problems.\n\n4. Only a **limited number of clinical signs** are used, selected on the basis of their sensitivity and specificity to detect disease through classification.\n\nA combination of individual signs leads to a **child's classification** within one or more symptom groups rather than a diagnosis. The classification of illness is based on a colour-coded triage system:  \n- ♦ **\"PINK\"** indicates urgent hospital referral or admission,  \n- ♦ **\"YELLOW\"** indicates initiation of specific outpatient treatment,  \n- ♦ **\"GREEN\"** indicates supportive home care.\n\n5. IMCI management procedures use **a limited number of essential drugs** and encourage active participation of caregivers in the treatment of their children.\n\n6. An essential component of IMCI is the **counselling of caregivers** regarding home care:  \n   * Appropriate feeding and fluids,  \n   * When to return to the clinic immediately, and  \n   * When to return for follow-up.\n\n",

The children and infants are then **assessed for main symptoms**:  \n   * In older children the main symptoms include:  \n     - Cough or difficulty breathing,  \n     - Diarrhoea,  \n     - Fever, and  \n     - Ear infection.  \n   * In young infants, the main symptoms include:  \n     - Local bacterial infection,  \n     - Diarrhoea, and  \n     - Jaundice.\n\n3. Then in addition, all sick children are **routinely checked** for:  \n   * Nutritional and immunization status,  \n   * HIV status in high HIV settings, and  \n   * Other potential problems.\n\n4. Only a **limited number of clinical signs** are used, selected on the basis of their sensitivity and specificity to detect disease through classification.\n\nA combination of individual signs leads to a **child's classification** within one or more symptom groups rather than a diagnosis. The classification of illness is based on a colour-coded triage system:  \n- ♦ **\"PINK\"** indicates urgent hospital referral or admission,  \n- ♦ **\"YELLOW\"** indicates initiation of specific outpatient treatment,  \n- ♦ **\"GREEN\"** indicates supportive home care.\n\n5. IMCI management procedures use **a limited number of essential drugs** and encourage active participation of caregivers in the treatment of their children.\n\n6.

These signs indicate severe illness and the need for immediate referral or admission to hospital.\n\n2. The children and infants are then **assessed for main symptoms**:  \n   * In older children the main symptoms include:  \n     - Cough or difficulty breathing,  \n     - Diarrhoea,  \n     - Fever, and  \n     - Ear infection.  \n   * In young infants, the main symptoms include:  \n     - Local bacterial infection,  \n     - Diarrhoea, and  \n     - Jaundice.\n\n3. Then in addition, all sick children are **routinely checked** for:  \n   * Nutritional and immunization status,  \n   * HIV status in high HIV settings, and  \n   * Other potential problems.\n\n4. Only a **limited number of clinical signs** are used, selected on the basis of their sensitivity and specificity to detect disease through classification.\n\nA combination of individual signs leads to a **child's classification** within one or more symptom groups rather than a diagnosis. The classification of illness is based on a colour-coded triage system:  \n- ♦ **\"PINK\"** indicates urgent hospital referral or admission,  \n- ♦ **\"YELLOW\"** indicates initiation of specific outpatient treatment,  \n- ♦ **\"GREEN\"** indicates supportive home care.\n\n5. IMCI management procedures use **a limited number of essential drugs** and encourage active participation of caregivers in the treatment of their children.\n\n6. An essential component of IMCI is the **counselling of caregivers** regarding home care:  \n   * Appropriate feeding and fluids,  \n   * When to return to the clinic immediately, and  \n   * When to return for follow-up.",
