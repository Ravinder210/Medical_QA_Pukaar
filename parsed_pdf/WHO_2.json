Thereafter, reassess the child by checking skin pinch, level of consciousness and ability to drink at least every hour, in order to confirm that hydration is improving. Sunken eyes recover more slowly than other signs and are less useful for monitoring.\n\nWhen the full amount of IV fluid has been given, reassess the child's hydration status fully, using Chart 7 (p. 13).\n\n* If signs of severe dehydration are still present, repeat the IV fluid infusion outlined earlier. Persistent severe dehydration after IV rehydration is unusual; it usually occurs only in children who pass large watery stools frequently during the rehydration period.\n\n* If the child is improving but still shows signs of some dehydration, discontinue IV treatment and give ORS solution for 4 h (see section 5.2.2 and treatment plan B, p. 135). If the child is usually breastfed, encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding frequently.\n\n* If there are no signs of dehydration, follow the guidelines in section 5.1.3 and treatment plan A, p. 138. When appropriate, encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding frequently. Observe the child for at least 6 h before\n\n130",

DIARRHOEA\n\n## SOME DEHYDRATION\n\ndischarge, to confirm that the mother is able to maintain the child's hydration by giving ORS solution.\n\nAll children should start to receive some ORS solution (about 5 ml/kg per h) by cup when they can drink without difficulty (usually within 3–4 h for infants and 1–2 h for older children). ORS provides additional base and potassium, which may not be adequately supplied by IV fluid.\n\nWhen severe dehydration is corrected, prescribe zinc (pp. 133–4).\n\n### 5.2.2 Some dehydration\n\nIn general, children with some dehydration should be given ORS solution for the first 4 h at a clinic, while the child is monitored and the mother is taught how to prepare and give ORS solution.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nIf the child has two or more of the following signs, he or she has some dehydration:\n\n* restlessness or irritability\n* thirsty and drinks eagerly\n* sunken eyes\n* skin pinch goes back slowly.\n\nNote that if a child has only one of the above signs and one of the signs of severe dehydration (e.g. restlessness or irritable and drinking poorly), then the child also has some dehydration.\n\n#### Treatment\n\n* In the first 4 h, give the child ORS solution according to the child's weight (or age if the weight is not known), as shown in Chart 14. If the child wants more to drink, give more.\n* Show the mother how to give the child ORS solution: a teaspoonful every 1–2 min if the child is < 2 years; frequent sips from a cup for an older child.\n* Check regularly to see whether there are problems.\n  - If the child vomits, wait 10 min; then, resume ORS solution more slowly (e.g. a spoonful every 2–3 min).\n  - If the child's eyelids become puffy, stop ORS solution, reduce the fluid intake and continue with breast milk. Weigh the child, and monitor urine output.",

DIARRHOEA\n\n## NO DEHYDRATION\n\n► Give zinc and advise the mother how much to give:\n≤ 6 months: half tablet (10 mg) per day for 10–14 days\n≥ 6 months: one tablet (20 mg) per day for 10–14 days\n\n### Feeding\nContinuation of nutritious feeding is an important element in the management of diarrhoea.\n► In the initial 4-h rehydration period, do not give any food except breast milk. Breastfed children should continue to breastfeed frequently throughout the episode of diarrhoea. If they cannot suck from the breast, consider giving expressed breast milk either orally from a cup or by nasogastric tube.\n► After 4 h, if the child still has some dehydration and ORS continues to be given, give food every 3–4 h.\n► All children > 6 months should be given some food before being sent home.\n\nIf the child is not normally breastfed, explore the feasibility of **relactation** (i.e. restarting breastfeeding after it was stopped, see p. 297) or give the usual breast milk substitute. If the child is ≥ 6 months or already taking solid food, give freshly prepared foods – cooked, mashed or ground. The following are recommended:\n\n• cereal or another starchy food mixed with pulses, vegetables and meat or fish, if possible, with 1–2 teaspoons of vegetable oil added to each serving\n• local complementary foods recommended by the IMCI in that area (see section 10.1.2, p. 299)\n• fresh fruit juice or mashed banana to provide potassium.\n\n► Encourage the child to eat by offering food at least six times a day. Give the same foods after the diarrhoea stops, and give an extra meal a day for 2 weeks.\n\n### 5.2.3 No dehydration\nChildren with diarrhoea but no dehydration should receive extra fluids at home to prevent dehydration. They should continue to receive an appropriate diet for their age, including continued breastfeeding.\n\n#### Diagnosis\nDiarrhoea with no dehydration should be diagnosed if the child does not have two or more signs that characterize some or severe dehydration, as described above (see Table 12, p. 128).\n\n134\n",

Feeding is often difﬁcult because of lack of appetite; return\nof appetite is an important sign of improvement.\n      Breastfeeding should be continued throughout the course of the illness,\n      more frequently than normal, if possible, because the infant may not take\n      the usual amount per feed.\n      Children aged 6 months or more should receive their normal foods. Encour-\n      age the child to eat, and allow the child to select preferred foods.\n\nComplications\n•     Dehydration. Dehydration is the commonest complication of dysentery, and\n      children should be assessed and managed for dehydration irrespective of\n      any other complication. Give ﬂuids according to treatment plan A, B or C,\n      as appropriate.\n•     Potassium depletion. Potassium depletion can be prevented by giving ORS\n      solution (when indicated) or potassium-rich foods such as bananas, coconut\n      water or dark-green leafy vegetables.\n•     High fever. If the child has high fever (\n                                           ≥ 39 °C or ≥ 102.2 °F) that appears to\n      be causing distress, give paracetamol and consider severe bacterial infection.\n•     Rectal prolapse. Gently push back the rectal prolapse using a surgical glove\n      or a wet cloth. Alternatively, prepare a warm solution of saturated magnesium\n      sulfate, and apply compresses with this solution to reduce the prolapse by\n      decreasing oedema.\n•     Convulsions. A single convulsion is the commonest ﬁnding. If they are pro-\n      longed or repeated, give diazepam (see chart 9, p. 15). Avoid giving rectal\n      diazepam. Always check for hypoglycaemia.\n•     Haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Where laboratory tests are not possible,\n      suspect haemolytic uraemic syndrome in patients with easy bruising, pallor,\n      altered consciousness and low or no urine output.\n•     Toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon usually presents with fever, abdominal\n      distension,  pain  and  tenderness  with  loss  of  bowel  sounds,  tachycardia\n      and dehydration. Give IV ﬂuids for dehydration, pass a nasogastric tube,\n      and start antibiotics.\nFurther details of treatment can be found in standard paediatric textbooks.\n\n146",
