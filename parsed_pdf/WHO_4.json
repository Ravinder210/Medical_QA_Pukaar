Initiate early feeding with small oral feeds even on day 1 or\nas soon as the infant can tolerate enteral feeds.\nVery low-birth-weight infants (< 1.5 kg)may have to be fed by naso- or orogastric\ntube during the ﬁrst days of life. Preferably give the mother’s expressed breast\nmilk. The mother can let the infant suck on her cleaned ﬁnger while being\ntube fed. This may stimulate the infant’s digestive tract and help weight gain.\nLow-birth-weight infants at ≥ 32 weeks’ gestational age can start suckling on\nthe breast. Let the mother put her infant to the breast as soon as the infant is\nwell enough. Continue giving expressed breast milk by cup or tube to make\nsure that the infant gets all the nutrition needed.\nInfants at ≥ 34–36 weeks’ gestational age can usually take all that they need\ndirectly from the breast.\n\nInfants who cannot breastfeed\nNon-breastfed infants should receive either:\n•     expressed breast milk (prefera-\n      bly from their own mothers) or\n      donor human milk where safe\n      and affordable milk-banking\n      facilities are available\n•     formula  milk  prepared  with\n      cl e an w a ter ac c or ding to\n      instructions or, if possible,\n      ready-made liquid formula\n•     If the above are not available,\n      consider animal milk.

There are only three con-\ntraindications to vaccination:\n•     Do not give BCG or yellow fever vaccine to a child with  symptomatic HIV\n      infection or AIDS, but do give the other vaccines.\n•     Do not give DPT-2 or -3 to a child who has had convulsions or shock within\n      3 days of the most recent dose.\n•     Do not give DPT to a child with recurrent convulsions or an active disease\n      of the central nervous system.\nA child with diarrhoea who is due to receive oral polio vaccine should be given\na dose, but this dose should not be counted in the schedule.

When feed and fluids can be given by mouth or nasogastric tube, this is the safest, preferable route.\n\n[object Object]\n\n<sup>a</sup> Half-strength Darrow's solution often comes without glucose, and glucose must be added before use.\n\n<sup>b</sup> These fluids can be used mainly in the first few days of life but not in other infants or children.\n\n377\n\n<table>\n    <thead>\n    <tr>\n        <th rowspan=\"3\">IV ﬂuid</th>\n        <th colspan=\"7\">Composition</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Na+</th>\n        <th>K+</th>\n        <th>Cl–</th>\n        <th>Ca++</th>\n        <th>Lactate</th>\n        <th>Glucose</th>\n        <th>Calories</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <th>mmol/l</th>\n        <th>mmol/l</th>\n        <th>mmol/l</th>\n        <th>mmol/l</th>\n        <th>mmol/l</th>\n        <th>g/l</th>\n        <th>cal/l</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Ringer’s lactate \n\n(Hartmann’s)</td>\n        <td>130</td>\n        <td>5.4</td>\n        <td>112</td>\n        <td>1.8</td>\n        <td>27</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Normal saline \n\n(0.9% NaCl)</td>\n        <td>154</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>154</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>10% glucose</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>100</td>\n        <td>400</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>0.45 NaCl/5% glucose</td>\n        <td>77</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>77</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>50</td>\n        <td>200</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Darrow’s solution</td>\n        <td>121</td>\n        <td>35</td>\n        <td>103</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>53</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Half-strength Darrow with \n\n5% glucoseᵃ</td>\n        <td>61</td>\n        <td>17</td>\n        <td>52</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>27</td>\n        <td>50</td>\n        <td>200</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Half-strength Ringer’s \n\nlactate with 5% glucose</td>\n        <td>65</td>\n        <td>2.7</td>\n        <td>56</td>\n        <td>1</td>\n        <td>14</td>\n        <td>50</td>\n        <td>200</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>0.18% NaCl/4% glucoseᵇ</td>\n        <td>31</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>31</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>40</td>\n        <td>160</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>5% glucoseᵇ</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>–</td>\n        <td>50</td>\n        <td>200</td>\n    </tr></table>\n\n",

Recumbent length is on average 0.5 cm greater than standing height, although the difference is of no importance for the individual child. A correction may be made by deducting 0.5 cm from all lengths > 84.9 cm if standing height cannot be measured.\n\nIn the tables:\n* Locate the appropriate table for boys or girls.\n* Locate the row containing the child's length in the left column.\n* Note where the child's weight lies with respect to the lengths recorded in this row.\n* Look up the column to read the weight-for-length of the child.\n\nExample 1: Boy: length 61 cm, weight 5.3 kg. His weight-for-length is –2 SD.\nExample 2: Girl: length 67 cm, weight 4.3 kg.

This second edition is based on evidence from several WHO updated and published clinical guidelines. It is for use in both inpatient and outpatient care in small hospitals with basic laboratory facilities and essential medicines. In some settings, these guidelines can be used in any facilities where sick children are admitted for inpatient care.\n\nThe Pocket Book is one of a series of documents and tools that support the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). The guidelines require the hospital to have (1) the capacity to carry out certain essential investigations, such as pulse oximetry, blood glucose, blood smear examinations for malaria parasites, estimation of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and full blood count, blood group and cross-match, and basic microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid and urine; and where possible blood and urine culture, ultrasound and basic x-rays; (2) essential medicines for the care of seriously ill children. Advanced and high care treatment options, such as intensive care or mechanical ventilation, are not described.\n\nThese guidelines focus on the management of the major causes of childhood mortality in most developing countries, such as newborn problems, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, septicaemia, measles and related conditions, severe acute malnutrition and paediatric HIV/AIDS. It also covers some common surgical conditions that can be managed in small hospitals.\n\nDetails of the evidence on which the Pocket Book is based can be found on WHO website from the published guidelines provided in the bibliography. These guidelines are applicable in most areas of the world and may be adapted to suit country specific circumstances. The online version will be updated regularly as new evidence emerges.\n\n**For further information please contact:**\n\nMaternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health (MCA)  \nWorld Health Organization  \n20 Avenue Appia, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland  \nTel +41-22 791 3281 • E-mail mncah@who.int  \nWebsite www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/en\n\n**ISBN 978 92 4 154837 3**",

The guidelines require the hospital to have (1) the capacity to carry out certain essential investigations, such as pulse oximetry, blood glucose, blood smear examinations for malaria parasites, estimation of haemoglobin, packed cell volume and full blood count, blood group and cross-match, and basic microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid and urine; and where possible blood and urine culture, ultrasound and basic x-rays; (2) essential medicines for the care of seriously ill children. Advanced and high care treatment options, such as intensive care or mechanical ventilation, are not described.\n\nThese guidelines focus on the management of the major causes of childhood mortality in most developing countries, such as newborn problems, pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, meningitis, septicaemia, measles and related conditions, severe acute malnutrition and paediatric HIV/AIDS. It also covers some common surgical conditions that can be managed in small hospitals.\n\nDetails of the evidence on which the Pocket Book is based can be found on WHO website from the published guidelines provided in the bibliography.
