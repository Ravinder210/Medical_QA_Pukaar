If IV glucose is not available, give\n      one teaspoon of sugar moistened with one or two drops of water sublingually,\n      and repeat every 20 min to prevent relapse.

In countries where infestation is prevalent, also give mebendazole to children with no evidence of infestation 7 days after admission.\n\n**HIV infection**\nWhere HIV infection is common, children with severe acute malnutrition should be tested for HIV to determine their need for antiretroviral therapy (ART). If the child is infected with HIV, start ART as soon as possible after stabilization of metabolic complications and sepsis. They should be monitored closely (inpatient and outpatient) in the first 6–8 weeks following initiation of ART to identify early metabolic complications and opportunistic infections (see Chapter 8).\n\n**Monitoring**\nIf the child is still anorexic after 7 days of antibiotic treatment, continue for a full 10-day course. If anorexia persists, reassess the child fully.\n\n### 7.4.6 Micronutrient deficiencies\n\nAll severely malnourished children have vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Although anaemia is common, do not give iron initially, but wait until the child has a good appetite and starts gaining weight (usually in the second week), because iron can make infections worse.\n\nMultivitamins including vitamin A and folic acid, zinc and copper are already present in F-75, F-100 and ready-to-use therapeutic food packets. When premixed packets are used, there is no need for additional doses.\n\nIn addition, if there are no eye signs or history of measles, then do not give a high dose of vitamin A because the amounts already present in therapeutic foods are enough.\n\n**Treatment**\n► Give vitamin A on day 1 and repeat on days 2 and 14 only if child has any signs of vitamin A deficiency like corneal ulceration or a history of measles (see section 7.5.1, p. 217).\n\n208\n",

          "md": "Diagnosis of HIV infection in perinatally exposed infants and young children < 18 months of age is difficult, because passively acquired maternal HIV antibodies may still be present in the child's blood. Additional diagnostic challenges arise if the child is still breastfeeding or has been breastfed. Although many children will have lost HIV antibodies between 9 and 18 months, a virological test is the only reliable method for determining the HIV status of a child < 18 months of age.\n\nWhen either the mother or the child has a positive serological HIV test and the child has specific symptoms suggestive of HIV infection but virological testing is not available, the child may presumptively be diagnosed as having HIV infection. However, HIV virological testing should be done at the earliest opportunity to confirm infection.\n\nAll diagnostic HIV testing of children must be confidential, be accompanied by counselling and conducted only with informed consent, so that it is both informed and voluntary.",

It may be more convenient to delay this until after ketamine has been given IM.\n\n* Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (short procedures) and analgesia for short painful procedures:\n* Give ketamine at 5–8 mg IM or 1–2 mg/kg IV over 60 s for surgical anaesthesia, adjusted according to response. The child should be ready in 2–3 min if given IV or 3–5 min if given IM.\n* Give a further dose of ketamine at 1–2 mg/kg IM or 0.5–1 mg/kg IV if the child responds to a painful stimulus.\n* Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia (longer procedures) by continuous IV infusion:\n* Neonate: Give initially 0.5–2 mg/kg loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion of 500 μg/kg per h, adjusted according to response; up to 2 mg/kg per h can be used to produce deep anaesthesia.\n* Infant or child: Give initially 0.5–2 mg/kg loading dose followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.5–2.5 mg/kg per h, adjusted according to response.\n* At the end of the procedure, turn the child into the lateral position and closely supervise recovery in a quiet place.\n\n258",

Use Ringer's lactate or normal saline with 5% glucose; for maintenance, use Ringer's lactate with 5% glucose or half-normal saline with 5% glucose.\n\n– First 24 h: Calculate fluid requirements by adding maintenance fluid requirements (p. 304) to the additional emergency fluid requirements (volume equal to 4 ml/kg for every 1% of surface burnt).\n\n► Administer half of total fluid in first 8 h, and remaining fluid in next 16 h.\n\nExample: 20 kg child with a 25% burn:\n   Total fluid in first 24 h = (60 ml/h x 24 h) + 4 ml x 20 kg x 25% burn\n   = 1440 ml + 2000 ml\n   = 3440 ml (1720 ml over first 8 h)\n\n– Second 24 h: give half to three quarters of fluid required during the first day.\n\n– Monitor the child closely while giving emergency fluids (pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure and urine output), taking care to avoid circulatory fluid overload.\n\n– Blood may be given to correct anaemia or for deep burns to replace blood loss.\n\n► In all cases, administer tetanus prophylaxis.\n\n► Prevent infection:\n\n– If skin is intact, clean with antiseptic solution, gently, without breaking the skin.\n\n– If skin is not intact, carefully debride the burn. Except for very small burns, debride all bullae, and excise adherent necrotic (dead) tissue during the first few days.\n\n– Give topical antibiotics or antiseptics (the options depend on resources; they include: silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, gentian violet, betadine and even mashed papaya). Clean and dress the wound daily.\n\n– Small burns and those in areas that are difficult to cover can be managed by leaving them open to the air and keeping them clean and dry.\n\n► Treat secondary infection if present.\n\n– If there is evidence of local infection (pus, foul odour or presence of cellulitis), treat with amoxicillin (15 mg/kg orally three times a day) plus\n\n271\n\n9.
